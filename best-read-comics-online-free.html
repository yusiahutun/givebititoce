There are numerous options available to you.</p><p>Marvel and DC have gained a lot of new fans with their increased cinematic presence, meaning a boost to the comic book industry. Unfortunately, visiting your local comic book store can prove expensive. Single issues typically cost $3.99. Milestone issues and variants cost even more. And some people don't even live near a comic shop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, you can save some money by using these sites to read comics online for free and completely legally. No matter what kind of comics you're into, you should find them on the best sites for free comics.</p><h2 id=marvel-unlimited>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Unlimited</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/marvel-unlimited-free-comics-2023.jpg><p>Where do you go to read Marvel Comics online for free? Marvel Unlimited is the obvious answer, but most know it solely as a paid-for service. With a monthly or annual subscription, you get access to over 30,000 comics. Its corresponding mobile app is one of <a href=#>the best Marvel apps for comic book fans</a>.</p><p>However, Unlimited offers a series of tasters, also giving you the chance to try out its smart panel interface. There's a good mix of big-name characters and lesser-known heroes, so you can explore plenty that the Marvel Universe has to offer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, you'll see a lot of debut series, but keep checking because it further features entire miniseries for you to enjoy, including comics related to current and previous shows and films, like Marvel's Hero Project on Disney+ and digital-exclusive "Infinity Comics" related to the Loki TV series. If you enjoy the app, you can join Marvel Unlimited with monthly or annual subscriptions. This includes downloads for offline reading, creator and character spotlights, and <a href=#>plenty more fantastic Marvel Unlimited features</a>.</p><h2 id=dc-universe-infinite>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC Universe Infinite</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dawn-of-dc-primer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Where can you go to read DC Comics online? DC Kids used to be a good option, and while it still features animations (for which the company is greatly celebrated, giving youngsters a good entry-point into comics), its comic selection has dwindled to nothing. Instead, then, there's DC Universe Infinity, the major publisher's alternative to Marvel Unlimited.</p><p>But this is region-locked, so isn't available to everyone. At the time of writing, readers in the UK, for instance, are exempt, as the main app that supports the free issues isn't ready yet.</p><p>If you're in America, Canada, or other select locations, however, you can enjoy a small but fair sample of freebies, notably issues released as part of Free Comic Book Day, an annual event in May that purports to help draw fans into independent comic book stores.</p><p>You'll find the big names here, i.e. Superman, Batman, and the Suicide Squad, so it's a decent way of introducing yourself or others to the worlds of DC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=libby>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Libby</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Libby-by-OverDrive.jpg><p>If you want to read comics online, Libby is an ideal choice. It's brought to you by your local library service, you get a whole host of free stuff to borrow for 21 days. Plus, if you're not sure you'd like a particular title, you can read a sample before borrowing properly.</p><p>There are sections for kids and teenagers, or you can just browse a wide archive of graphic novels, magazines, and even audiobooks.</p><p>You need a library card, but because this app is sponsored by local libraries all across the world, you can actually request a card from your nearest library. You can borrow up to 10 titles at one time and download them for free too, so if you're going on vacation and can't guarantee internet access, this is a top choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dark-horse-39-s-free-books>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Horse's Free Books</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dark-horse-free-comics.jpg><p>Dark Horse is a great heavy-hitter with the license for numerous much-loved franchises. The company's Free Books page is a reflection of that, which also acts as a great way of getting newcomers into comics.</p><p>Let's say you have a friend who loves Stranger Things. Get them hooked by introducing them to the free comics! Maybe you love playing Overwatch. Why not take some time away from the PlayStation by sampling Dark Horse's miniseries expanding on that world?</p><p>Other popular brands you'll find here include Minecraft, The Umbrella Academy, Hellboy, Avatar, and Mass Effect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drivethru-comics>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DriveThru Comics</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DriveThru-Comics.jpg><p>You won't find the big two here: Marvel and DC are absent from the list of publishers on DriveThru. However, there's a large collection of books with a variety of comics that span genres and styles. And you will find Marvel and DC's bigger competitors, like Valiant Comics, Top Cow, and Aspen Comics.</p><p>Most first issues are free, and if you like the series, you can buy subsequent issues from the store. Many of those that aren't free are available on a pay-what-you-want basis.</p><p>DriveThru's filters can be used to browse genres, formats, publishers, and prices. Use them to narrow down the selection of comics and start exploring. It's hard to know what you'll find here, but DriveThru is always a good place to read free comics online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amazon-best-sellers>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Amazon Best Sellers</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/free-comics-on-amazon.jpg><p>You might not think of Amazon as a good place to find free comic books.

You can spend days reading free comic books from the Golden Age (i.e. 1930s to 1950s).</p><p>The titles and characters may not be familiar—though Captain Marvel, now widely known as Shazam, does show up—but you can see how the Golden Age books had a strong influence on today's works.</p><p>You won't find modern comic books here. Nonetheless, it's fun to browse through the classic titles from 70+ years ago and see how the artwork and storytelling have changed.

And GoComics is your top resource for syndicated strips.</p><p>There are two subscription options: free and paid. Fortunately, the former is all you really need (although we encourage readers to support the service).
