These colossal creatures stood up to 11 feet tall at the shoulder and could weigh up to 6 tons. Their long, curved tusks could reach a length of up to 16 feet. These giants grazed on grasses and other vegetation, and their thick fur and hump of fat helped them survive the harsh cold temperatures. The Woolly Mammoth went extinct around 4,000 years ago.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-2>Saber-toothed Tigers had enormous, sharp teeth.</h2><p>The Saber-toothed Tiger, also known as the Smilodon, was not actually a tiger but a prehistoric predator. It had saber-like canines that could grow up to 7 inches long. These elongated teeth were used to pierce the flesh of their prey. Saber-toothed Tigers were around the same size as modern African lions, with a muscular build and short tail. They lived in North and South America during the Ice Age and became extinct about 10,000 years ago.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>The Giant Sloth was a slow-moving creature.</h2><p>The Giant Sloth was one of the largest ground-dwelling mammals of the Ice Age. Despite its sluggish nature, it had strong limbs and sharp claws that it used for defense and climbing trees. This herbivorous animal could reach lengths of up to 20 feet and weigh up to 4 tons. It had a distinctive appearance with its long, curved claws and a broad, flat head. The Giant Sloth became extinct around 11,000 years ago.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>9 Mindblowing Facts About Australian Funnelweb</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>The Dire Wolf was larger than modern-day wolves.</h2><p>The Dire Wolf was an Ice Age predator that was larger and more robust than its modern-day relatives. It had a stocky build, well-suited for hunting large prey. These carnivorous beasts lived in packs and had strong jaws lined with sharp teeth. Dire Wolves became extinct around 9,500 years ago and were most commonly found in North and South America.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>The Smilodon was not related to modern felines.</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, the Smilodon, commonly known as the saber-toothed cat, was not closely related to modern-day felines. It had a more stout body structure and unique adaptations. These prehistoric predators had a short tail, powerful forelimbs, and strong neck muscles that enabled them to deliver deadly bites to their prey. Smilodons hunted large <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=herbivores data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>herbivores</a> such as bison and horses.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Giant Ground Sloths were taller than giraffes.</h2><p>The Giant Ground Sloths were massive creatures that stood taller than giraffes during the Ice Age. They had long front legs and powerful claws that allowed them to dig burrows. These herbivorous mammals primarily fed on plants and leaves. Fossils of these incredible animals have been found in North and South America, indicating their widespread presence during the Ice Age. The Giant Ground Sloths went extinct around 10,000 years ago.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>The Irish Elk had the largest antlers of any deer species.</h2><p>The Irish Elk, or Megaloceros, was a magnificent creature with enormous antlers that spanned up to 12 feet from tip to tip. Despite its name, the Irish Elk was not closely related to the elk species we know today. Males used their impressive antlers to compete for mates during the breeding season. These majestic animals became extinct around 7,700 years ago.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>The American Lion was one of the largest cats of all time.</h2><p>The American Lion, also known as the Panthera atrox, was one of the largest cats to have ever existed. It was about 25% larger than modern African lions. These muscular predators roamed North America during the Ice Age and hunted large herbivores like bison and mammoths. The American Lion went extinct around 11,000 years ago.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>The Cave Lion had a thick, shaggy coat.</h2><p>The Cave Lion, or Panthera leo spelaea, was a subspecies of lion that lived in Eurasia during the Ice Age. It had a robust build and a distinctive thick, shaggy coat. This adaptation helped them survive in the cold climate. Cave Lions were skilled hunters and lived in groups called prides. They became extinct around 14,000 years ago.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>19 Facts About Hawks</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>Woolly Rhinos had a hump of muscle on their shoulders.</h2><p>The Woolly Rhinoceros, also known as Coelodonta, had a unique adaptation in the form of a hump of muscle on its shoulders. This hump served as a resource store during times of scarcity. These massive herbivores had two large horns made of keratin, the same material found in human hair and nails. Woolly Rhinos lived across Europe and northern Asia during the last Ice Age and went extinct around 10,000 years ago.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, the Ice Age was a fascinating period in the Earth’s history, filled with a wide variety of unique and incredible animals.
