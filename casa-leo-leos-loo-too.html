In recent years, many products have been released with the promise to simplify the process of cleaning after your cat companions and to help reduce the mess and smell from their bathroom habits. I've seemingly been trying a new solution every year in hopes of keeping my home tidier and my cats happier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-06-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Casa Leo Leo's Loo Too</h5>8<span>/ 10</span><p class=display-card-description>The Casa Leo's Loo Too is available in many colors to match your home (or your cat). Assembly is easy and there are plenty of accessories, such as the included liners or a mat, to reduce any mess when your cat exits the litter box. Potentially less intimidating than competitors, small and medium cats won't have an issue entering the litter box, but larger cats may struggle.</p><p>When the waste drawer is full, you'll get a notification from the companion app. Simply pull out the drawer and dispose of the waste. But what really sets Leo's Loo Too apart is its safety features. Inside there is a radar system, weight sensors, and an anti-pinch sensor. These help to protect your cat inside the drum, ensuring no cleaning cycle commences while they are in there. It also runs at less than 30dB, which is quiet considering what it's doing, and there's also a UV sterilization system that disinfects the inside of the litter box and removes 99 percent of bacteria.</p><strong>Brand</strong> <span>Smarty Pear</span> <strong>Connectivity</strong> <span>Wi-Fi</span> <strong>Color</strong> <span>White, Pink, Green</span> <strong>Material</strong> <span>Plastic</span> <strong>Dimensions</strong> <span>24 x 22 x 27.5 inches</span> <strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Simplifies the process of collecting cat waste</li><li class=icon>Very easy installation and operation</li><li class=icon>Nearly silent when cleaning</li><li class=icon>App offers informative notifications</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>Minimal litter tracking management</li><li class=icon>Requires a large space for placement</li><li class=icon>Some design quirks which easily trap litter</li><li class=icon>The cat step is simply jumped over by my cats</li></ul><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><p>Casa Leo (formally Smarty Pear) has unveiled the latest in their Leo's Loo line of automatic litter boxes, the Leo's Loo Too. They claim that it'll "improve life for you and your fur baby". I put this claim to the test with the help of some cat coworkers (paid handsomely for their efforts with lots of treats).</p><p>My initial impression was positive, and I, and my feline friends, found it easy and convenient to use. Despite its hefty price tag, it is comparable to most other high-end electronic litter boxes on the market, though there a few areas where Leo's Loo Too could improve.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-12.jpg><h2 id=pricing-and-other-options>Pricing and Other Options</h2><p>We received the Leo's Loo Too Starter Bundle which costs $700 before tax, shipping, or any coupons or discounts. Compared with similar automatic boxes on the market, it is on the higher end of prices, but includes extras such as a custom-fit litter mat shaped to fit perfectly at its base, custom waste drawer liners, and three adorable plush cat toys.</p><p>The Loo Too alone without those add-ons goes for $650, and is also offered with a 3-year extended warranty for $750, which for added piece of mind, may be worth it to some users. Shelters, veterinary clinics, or cat caf√©s may also be interested in their multi-product discount, which saves $100 for each additional Loo Too purchase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-13-1.jpg><p>Other competing automatic litter boxes, such as the Litter Robot 4, can be purchased for $700, doesn't require any assembly, and is plug-and-play. However, it does not include any of the accessories available in the Loo Too's starter bundle for that price and is only available in black and white. The Loo Too, by comparison, can be purchased in Leo Gray, Avocado Green, Baby Blue, or Pretty Pink for no additional cost.</p><p>Another option, the ScoopFree Self-Cleaning litter box, costs $140 dollars, but requires a rather expensive proprietary crystal litter system and does not come with accompanying smart features or app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A mid-range option can be found in the CatGenie's A.I. Self-Washing Cat Box, with their standard package offered for around $480, which offers a more hands-off, automatic flushing and cleaning system, similar to an actual toilet. However, it does require some time-consuming and messy plumbing, as well as their SaniSolution Cartridges and Washable Granules instead of typical litter. I have personally bought and used the ScoopFree and CatGenie solutions, and when compared to the Leo Loo Too, I found that the Leo has a few key benefits, but at the same time a few oversights too, which I'll share in this review.</p><h2 id=assembly-and-setup>Assembly and Setup</h2><p>The Loo Too arrived in a large, unwieldy, but surprisingly lightweight box.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-14-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Inside, you'll find the base, drum, and top portions of the litter box; a power adapter with a chew-resistant cord, charcoal air filters, and ten waste drawer liners as well as the user manuals and guides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-01-1.jpg><p>Setup was simple and straightforward. Once I was sure that the drum was correctly seated, I could fit the top of the device into place, add litter, liners, and plug it in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-17-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cord is rather short, so that will restrict where you can place the Loo Too in your home without the use of extension cords, but the attention to detail of an anti-chew cord was a good choice from the Casa Leo team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-21-1.jpg><p>One of the key benefits with this system over most other high end options, is the ability to use any brand of clumping clay litter, though Casa Leo does recommend Dr. Elsey's. We tried Purina Tidy Cats Light Weight and later Dr. Elsey's, however, we didn't notice any difference in terms of how well the litter box cleaned‚Äîor its effectiveness on reducing tracking litter, which we quickly noticed the Loo Too does little to address, even with its custom-fitted mat and its cat step.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-20-1.jpg><p>It is important to note that the use of any other type of litter other than clumping clay litter will damage the device and void the warranty. To our surprise, getting the litter into the box can be a little difficult, especially when using Dr. Elsey's, which unlike many other litter brands, did not have an easy open perforated side to help you pour it out. Because of the size and orientation of the drum opening, it was essentially impossible to turn the box of litter upside down enough to allow us to refill the drum. As such, we resorted to using a small jar to scoop the litter out. It's not a huge inconvenience, however, given that this was the recommended brand, we at least thought there would be some upside to choosing this pricier option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The experience is improved slightly if you use a product that has a pourable spout, though again, at lower levels, the process becomes tricky when you're trying to shake out the last granules in the box. In this case, the inclusion of a litter scoop would have been a welcome addition to the starter bundle (instead of the cute plush toys, perhaps!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-24-1.jpg><p>Moving on, once your litter is added up to the maximum level line inside the drum, you should install the waste drawer liners and filters. The drawer is located directly under the entrance to the litter box and slides out easily using its handle. A clear plastic lid covers the liner, holds it in place, and features a wide opening to catch all waste sifted from the drum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-22-1.jpg><p>The lid is secured by two hinges in the back that I quickly discovered were not as strong as I would have liked, and lifting the lid resulted in its entire removal most of the time. These hinges also prevented the liners from totally fitting around all of the edges of the waste drawer, and made it a little more difficult for the bag to sit as flush and open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-23-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While I try and make sure the liner is seated properly, and is as open and clear at the opening as possible, I do see the potential for the liner to fold over itself where the hinges are and allow for some waste to fall outside of the bag if a user is not careful, which happened to me the first time I had to empty it. The instructions state to ensure the edges of the liner are smooth, so it does seem to be an important feature to keep in mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-02-1.jpg><p>On a positive note, the drawer is an extra compartment that can be used for storing unused bags, charcoal, filters, or other accessories so that they are ready for use when it is time to empty the box and replace the liner. With the device assembled, filled with litter, and lined appropriately, it is ready to be plugged in and turned on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=app-features-and-functions>App Features and Functions</h2><p>After downloading the Casa Leo app and creating an account, you are instructed to long press the power button on the front of their Loo Too for three seconds until you hear three beeps and see a rapidly flashing white light.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-16-1.jpg><p>The device can only connect to a 2.4GHz network, so keep that in mind. Once the device is found, it will be added to your Wi-Fi network and connected to your account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-26-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was my first introduction to a truly smart litter box, as I never felt the need to use the app associated with the SmartGenie. I was impressed with the range of features offered by Casa Leo. The app shows the device's current status, and allows you to adjust settings, or initiate a manual UV sterilization or cleaning process.</p><p>You can also see a record of its use, including date, time, and information such as the weight of the specific pet that used it then. The activity record can also alert you to blockages detected by the anti-pinch sensor. This is an incredible asset to owners who want to keep a close eye on their cat's health, as litter box usage and weight changes are indicators of health issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-27-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In-app settings can be adjusted to control the number of drum rotations per cleaning cycle, the time delay for cleanings after a kitty leaves the Loo Too, and to schedule daily cleanings or sterilizations. The filter and litter replacement countdown can be monitored or reset, and you will get an alert when it is time to make a change. The app also includes a sleep mode for when the device needs to be powered down for an extended amount of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-28-1.jpg><p>The Loo Too can be controlled by more than just the app as well, with voice control enabled. This allows users to turn the device on and off, and adjust modes between manual and automatic using Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant. Though I can't imagine too many users taking advantage of this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-29-1.jpg><h2 id=operation>Operation</h2><p>When the Loo Too is plugged in and turned on for the first time, it will automatically rotate in a full circle while its power button flashes. During this time, you're advised to watch and observe for any abnormal function in its sifting or rotation in case it was damaged during transport. One of the first things I noticed while observing it was its near-silent operation. The Loo Too has "whisper-quiet" sifting of around 30 dB that even my cats barely noticed. This feature means that users can have it virtually anywhere in their homes without fear of it interfering with daily life or sleep.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-11-1.jpg><p>The Loo Too has some key features during daily use, with automatic sifting after each visit from your feline friend, triple-layer safety protection, and an odor-reducing UV light that claims to kill up to 99.9% of bacteria. Smart safety features include a radar system and four weight sensors that detect when kitty is inside the drum, as well as an Anti-Pinch Sensor at the top of the waste drawer to protect paws and pet parents' fingers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-31-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Loo Too offers a programmable UV light, that can be triggered in-app or set to work automatically, that addresses odor issues well. By sterilizing the waste drawer, and eliminating bacteria, parasites, and viruses, it also eliminates much of the cause of unpleasant smells. It makes me more comfortable handling the waste bags so that we are all exposed to less harmful pathogens. This, along with the larger waste drawer, meant the Loo Too had the least amount of odor of any litter box I have used‚Äîwhen I made sure to empty the drawer on time, which was usually once a week for my two cats. This is easy to do with the notifications from the app, letting me know when it was time to change the liner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-30-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As with any litter box switch, there's always the concern that your cats might not adjust as quickly, or worse ... completely hate it. I am fortunate to have the most easy-going and relaxed cats and have never had an issue with apprehension or refusal to use a new litter box or device, despite changing them almost once a year. I think by this point they're used to this and recognize if there's litter in a container of some sort, that means it's ok to do the business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-15-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once introduced to the Loo Too, and placed inside for a quick sensory adjustment, both of them knew exactly what it was for. In fact, within a few minutes of setup, one of them used it for the first time. Understandably everyone's cats will react differently, however, to its benefit, the Loo Too's smart detection features and quiet operation should go a long way to helping them become comfortable and familiar with it in the first place.</p><h3 id=tracking>Tracking</h3><p>While my cats are professionals at acclimating to new bathroom setups, to say that they're a bit erratic in how they use it is an understatement. This is why the ability to keep the area around the litter box and floor clean is a key focus of mine when deciding on how well a litter system works. While the included litter mat does help contain some of the loose granules when our cats would jump out of the box, the surrounding areas had lots of tracking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-33-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To further minimize this, including a flexible flap or cat door such as the one offered by CatGenie would have gone a long way at cutting down errant litter spray while they kick around. From our weeks of testing, we found that tracking was on par with your traditional "dumb" covered litter box. Which is to say: not very good. In fact, prior to switching to the Loo Too, our cats were using pine litter in one of these simple covered litter boxes, and we had virtually no tracking thanks to the larger pine litter pieces.</p><p>One add-on for Casa Leo that's intended to help mitigate some tracking issues is a small rubber step at the entrance. I wouldn't call it a step, exactly, as it doesn't stick out much and was entirely avoided by our cats in favor of just jumping in and out at their leisure. This is where the Loo Too loses out in design compared to the Litter Robot, which has a more robust step included but also offers an optional attachable ramp that can encourage cats to exit more gracefully.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-34-1.jpg><h3 id=cleaning>Cleaning</h3><p>It is recommended that you deep clean your Loo Too device once per month. This is done by detaching the hood and removing the drum from its base; then cleaning each thoroughly. Old litter is emptied out, and the drum should be washed with soap and water. Once completed, all of its pieces should be rebuilt and fresh litter installed. While some automatic litter devices like the Litter Robot 4 are more robust and can be sprayed down with a hose for cleaning, Casa Leo advises users to carefully wipe down each piece with a cloth and cleaning solution and avoid using water on the base as it will damage the electronics inside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-06-1.jpg><h2 id=great-smart-features-and-easy-cleaning-but-tracking-could-be-improved>Great Smart Features and Easy Cleaning, but Tracking Could Be Improved</h2><p>Starting at $650, this smart litter box is likely going to be a more expensive toilet than the one you use. Considering how much it offers and the potential time it could save you, it may be a worthy investment.</p><p>Leo's Loo Too provides your cats with a clean, comfortable space that gives you peace of mind when it comes to their health and makes your life as a pet parent easier. Despite its substantial cost, for those who want longer intervals between when they need to empty out or clean a litter box and value the additional insights it can offer, its useful functionality and smart features are only offset by its relatively ineffective tracking management.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will this make your cat ignore you any less? Probably not... but at least now you can ignore their loo a little more and return the favor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/casa-leo-leo-s-loo-too-06-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Casa Leo Leo's Loo Too</h5>8<span>/ 10</span><p class=display-card-description>The Casa Leo's Loo Too is available in many colors to match your home (or your cat). Assembly is easy and there are plenty of accessories, such as the included liners or a mat, to reduce any mess when your cat exits the litter box. Potentially less intimidating than competitors, small and medium cats won't have an issue entering the litter box, but larger cats may struggle.</p><p>When the waste drawer is full, you'll get a notification from the companion app. Simply pull out the drawer and dispose of the waste. But what really sets Leo's Loo Too apart is its safety features. Inside there is a radar system, weight sensors, and an anti-pinch sensor. These help to protect your cat inside the drum, ensuring no cleaning cycle commences while they are in there. It also runs at less than 30dB, which is quiet considering what it's doing, and there's also a UV sterilization system that disinfects the inside of the litter box and removes 99 percent of bacteria.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiamquRYrmmu4ylnKirXaG8sHnTqKZo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcasa-leo-leos-loo-too.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcasa-leo-leos-loo-too.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcasa-leo-leos-loo-too.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcasa-leo-leos-loo-too.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcasa-leo-leos-loo-too.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcasa-leo-leos-loo-too.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./understand-peer-pressure-inculcate-good-habits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./understand-peer-pressure-inculcate-good-habits.html>Understand peer pressure: Inculcate good habits</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lady-gaga-bike-riding-photos.html>Lady Gaga Dresses Down For Afternoon Bike Ride -- What a Difference!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lady-gaga-bike-riding-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
