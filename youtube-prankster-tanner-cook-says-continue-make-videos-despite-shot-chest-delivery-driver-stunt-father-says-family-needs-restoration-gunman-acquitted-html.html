He said Colie simply wasn't exhibiting the type of reaction Cook was looking for.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There was no reaction,' Cook said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutor Eden Holmes had said during the trial that the facts of the case don't support a self-defense argument, as Colie's lawyer had argued.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The law requires that Colie reasonably fear that he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and that he use no more force than is necessary. She said Cook's prank was bizarre but not threatening.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They were playing a silly phrase on a phone,' the prosecutor said.

One of the friends urges that it be 'short, weird and awkward'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pouilliard said during closing arguments that Colie is aware of the dangers that delivery drivers can face as they interact with the public and that he has a license to carry a concealed weapon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite whatever events precipitated the shooting Cook's father, Jeramy Cook, said the incident was shocking and unnecessary.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They were making a video at the mall and trying to have fun with people and this guy wasn't having fun,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There was a phone that was around him and they were interviewing or talking to him, and he didn't like it and he pulled out his gun and shot my son.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jeramy Cook emphasised that his family's faith in God to get them through this trying time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We need restoration, we need healing, and we need to come together.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I pray for this young man and pray that he finds God in this. I believe that God saved our son's life, and he could have easily died but that's not the outcome. God has plans for my son,' he said, noting that he bears no ill will toward Colie.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The jury was initially 'divided in terms of whether the defendant acted in self defense' but eventually delivered its verdicts at the end of the day. Collie was found not guilty of aggravated malicious wounding but was convicted on a lesser firearms count.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Colie's defense attorney Adam Pouilliard said the conviction on the firearms charge is inconsistent with the law, given Colie's acquittal on self defense grounds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He asked the judge to set aside the conviction. A judge will hear arguments on the issue at a hearing next month.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Colie, who has been in custody since his April arrest, will remain incarcerated.</p><p

unsuspecting customers through department stores.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He spoke from his hospital bed at the time of the incident and said he was just playing a joke on Colie.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was playing a prank and a simple practical joke, and this guy didn't take it very well,' he told WUSA9.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cook also insisted the incident will not deter him from continuing to make videos and has posted three videos since.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At a preliminary hearing, sheriff's deputies testified that they were well aware of Cook and have received calls about previous stunts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cook acknowledged during cross-examination on Tuesday that mall security had tossed him out the day prior to the shooting as he tried to record pranks, and that he was trying to avoid security the day he targeted Colie.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cook said he continues to make the videos, from which he earns $2,000 to $3,000 a month.</p><p class=postsid
