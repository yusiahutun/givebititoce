The US Census Bureau reports 16% of all children, which is roughly 11.6 million, are step children; 13% of adults are step parents (29-30 million); 15% of men are stepdads (16.5 million) and 12% of women are step moms (14 million). There is a stereotype surrounding the perception of what people think a step parent is (like the evil step mother in Cinderella) and yet the reality is this is a tough role for many women. Which is why support groups for step moms is so important.</p><p><strong>Hollywood’s version of step moms</strong></p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Hollywood has made many movies involving step moms. In the 1985 film, “St. Elmo’s Fire,” Demi Moore refers to her stepmom as her step-monster. We all know Cinderella’s story with her stepmother. Then there was the 1998 film, “Stepmom,” starring Julia Roberts (Isabel) and Susan Sarandon (Jackie). Roberts’s character becomes the stepmom to Sarandon’s two on-screen children, Jena Malone (Anna) and Liam Aiken (Ben). Despite her good intentions, most of the storyline centers on how Isabel is scrutinized and can’t do anything right, until Jackie, Anna, and Ben, turn a corner and are willing to give Isabel a chance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is there a gender bias?</h2><p>Are the challenges of becoming stepparent harder for women than men? Yes and no.<br>While research found becoming a stepdad is more socially acceptable than becoming a stepmom, both genders face challenges when they marry into an established family. According to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, a stepparent can create the sense of loss and change for a child and for any step-couple trying to unite the old and the new, experts say you should allow at least two years of an adjustment phase for everyone to get used to the new dynamic and keep your expectations to a realistic level.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Carol Brady effect lives on</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GettyImages-3227572.jpg><p>The notion that all stepmothers are evil couldn’t be further from the truth. When Carol Brady, a mom of three girls marries Mike Brady, a father of three boys on “The Brady Bunch,” she makes it known that the only steps in their household are the ones leading up to everyone’s bedroom. There are many pros to becoming a stepmom and a plus one to the family. Discover why welcoming another member to the team has its advantages.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You Can Be Influential</h3><p>A woman who chose to remain anonymous gushed about her stepmother on Quora, a social question-and-answer website that launched in 2009. In her post, the woman shared how she and her brother lost their mom when they were one and three. Their dad remarried to a woman she described as a positive role model and because of her love, guidance, and support, the writer shared how it inspired her to become a doctor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You Get & Give Extra Love</h3><p>Supermodel Gisele Bundchen said this about ex-husband Tom Brady’s Jack from a previous relationship, “I use the word bonus mom because I feel like it’s a blessing in my life. I feel so lucky that I got to have an extra, wonderful little angel in my life.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You Can Set The Tone</h3><p>When “Selling Sunsets” star & real estate agent Heather Rae El Moussa became a stepmom to her husband Tareek’s two children she said, “These kids are truly our everything, so we decided to say our vows first to the kids and second to each other. This is just a tiny portion of what I said to the kids, but I truly meant every word: When your daddy and I decided to be fully committed, I was 100 percent committing myself to you too.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sounding Board</h3><p>Amy Stone, a life coach who helps adults in blended families and is a stepmom herself says, “As a stepparent, I am an outside voice and I often found this to be an advantage because I had a non-parent perspective that was occasionally helpful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GettyImages-177259522.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>A Trusted Confidant</h3><p><strong></strong>On the social media platform Reddit writer, Mapper9 shared, that as the stepmom to a teenage girl, the benefits are amazing. I get to play the smarter more experienced friend and have conversations about the sensitive topics that may be awkward for her to have with her parents because I’m not her mom or dad, so I feel like she really gets the message.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You Re-Discover Yourself</h3><p>When Gwyneth Paltrow was talking about her role as a stepmom to husband Brad Falchuk’s two children on her Goop Podcast, the Oscar winner said, “It’s been a really interesting challenge for me and I love them. I’ve learned so much about myself through the process.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It’s Gratifying</h3><p>Kristen Skiles, a Certified Stepparent Coach and stepmom herself writes, “The reality is, being a stepmother is a choice to love, nurture, and help a child grow. It is not about the glory, and it is definitely not an attempt to replace the crucial role that only a biological mother can fill, but it is a supplement to that role.&nbsp;A biological mother and a stepmother work toward the same goal. Both want to raise brilliant, successful, beautiful children.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You Relive Childhood Memories</h3><p>In the words of Princess Beatrice, “I had the great honor to become a stepmother, and have had the most remarkable time going back over some of my most favorite stories at bedtime.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stepmom support group podcasts have lots of great advice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GettyImages-956320790.jpg><p>We live in an age where Podcasts are the rage and one of the most popular ways people are getting their news, information, sports, and entertainment.
