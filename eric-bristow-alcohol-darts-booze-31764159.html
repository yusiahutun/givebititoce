Bristow, who sadly passed away in April 2018 following a heart attack at the age of 60, also won five World Masters titles and was awarded an MBE for services to sport in 1989.</p><p>He fondly remembered his time playing for England with "hardcore boys who could drink." The darts legend admitted he enjoyed a drink but knew when to stop, especially before an important tournament.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Luke Littler says 'it's crazy' as he is stopped by Arsenal's Rice and Ramsdale for picture</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Michael van Gerwen calls out 'poo pants' players at PDC World Darts Championship</a></b></p><p>However, he shared a memorable story about being caught out by fellow player Cliff Lazarenko - known for his prolific drinking ability - on their way to the Canadian Open. The pair were upgraded to first class for the 12-hour flight, and the champagne started flowing.</p><p>"I knew I was in for a rough ride after having four or five pints at the airport bar," read an extract from the book. "Then, on the plane, it was champagne galore until they ran out. We'd finished all 12 bottles on board. Cliff then started ordering more drinks - Cointreau, Bailey's on ice, then Southern Comfort.</p><p>"When we landed, I was so drunk I was worried about getting through customs. I tried to sober up by splashing cold water on my face in the toilet. I was seeing double and struggled to say goodbye to the stewardess. Luckily, I managed to get through customs."</p><p><b><i>Where does Eric Bristow rank among the best darts players of all time?

However, Bristow and Lazarenko's lash had made for a close call on this occasion.</p><p>"At the hotel, Cliff said we should freshen up and meet in the bar in 25 minutes. After a quick shower, I headed downstairs," the passage continued. "It was only seven in the evening. We had a few beers in the hotel bar before heading to a nearby British Legion for a game of darts. The beers at the hotel had topped me up again and I was completely wrecked.</p><p>"We returned to the bar, then hit a rock bar and a few more late-night spots for more drinks. By this point, I was struggling to stand up. I was completely out of it, not knowing what day it was or even which country we were in. We ended up in a bar with 18 different spirits lined up. We drank vodka, brandy, whisky, gin, rum, Bacardi, and more until we'd tried all 18. The measures were much larger than what you'd get back in England.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31762129.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN-PICS-Luke-Littlers-Christmas-haul-as-darts-genius-hopes-to-show-Man-Utd-how-to-win-a-troph.jpg> <span class=factbox-header><h3>Join the Daily Star's WhatsApp for the sexiest headlines, showbiz gossip and lots more</h3></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!</p><p>Through the app, we'll send you the sassiest showbiz stories, some naught headline and a seismic smattering of aliens...along with the latest breaking news of course.</p><p>To join our community, all you have to do to join is<b><a href=# rel=nofollow> click on this link</a></b>, select 'Join Chat' and you're in!</p><p>No one will be able to see who has sign up and no one can send messages except for the Daily Star team.

I don't remember buying or eating it, and I'm amazed I made it back to my room. The curry stayed there for another day and a half because I couldn't get out of bed for the next 36 hours. I had alcohol poisoning and was shaking uncontrollably. In hindsight, I should've gone to hospital, but I just kept drinking water in my room. I did the same thing in Las Vegas a few years later.</p><p>"I got hooked on gambling and spent 28 hours at the tables, downing White Russians non-stop. But I won $12,000 so it didn't matter. After that, I went to bed and passed out, losing another day-and-a-half. Cliff and I had another encounter years later during a TV tournament in Scotland. We both missed our darts for the win, got knocked out and ended up drowning our sorrows at the bar with large Southern Comforts.</p><p>"I'm not one for spirits, never have been. The next day, I was shaking like a leaf and couldn't move. After that experience, I never tried to keep up with Cliff's drinking again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12321883.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_SUNDAYPEOPLE-PROD-Eric-Bristow.jpg><p>Recovering from those heavy drinking sessions sometimes took days. Even when Bristow thought he'd shaken off a hangover, it often took half a week before he felt fully recovered.</p><p>It's only natural to draw a connection between Bristow's diet and his sudden death from a heart attack while walking back to his car at Liverpool's Echo Arena. And the oche icon was aware of the signs, too, often wondering how his liver didn't pack in sooner when he returned from trips abroad.</p><p>"If I had died in my sleep, they would've done an autopsy and thought, 'This bloke deserved it'. The American tournaments were the worst, starting at 10 in the morning and ending at two the next morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31393559.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_PS081123dailystarchat.jpg> <span class=disclaimer-text>This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.</span> <a href=#>Learn more</a> Watch Premier League matches on Amazon Prime Video <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Amazon Prime Video membership</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31572181.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_amazon.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Prime Video is available as part of the Amazon Prime membership, which costs £8.99 per month or £95 annually for an individual.</p><p>The membership gives access to all the perks of Amazon Prime (including free Premium and Same- Day Delivery in selected residential postcodes, and other benefits) plus the full library of content available through Prime Video.</p><p>Prime also offers a discounted membership, Prime Student for higher education students.</p><p>You can also sign-up for Prime Video on its own for £5.99 per month, however, you won’t get the other benefits that come with Prime — like free One-Day Delivery and Same-Day Delivery on eligible orders and fast grocery delivery and pickup.</p><span class=price><p>£5.99 per month for Prime Video only, or £8.99 per month for Amazon Prime membership</p></span><span class=info>Amazon</span> <a class=buynow-button href=# rel=nofollow>Buy Now</a><p>"At two o'clock, you'd grab a few beers, hit the sack for a few hours, then get up and ready for the next day's play which started at 10. It was non-stop darts until two the next morning. If you were good, it would be a straight 16-hour shift; no food, just boozing, sleeping, and getting up at eight for breakfast.</p><p>Said breakfast would begin with a Bailey's coffee "to calm the shakes from the night before."

Thank Christ for that, it's over.'"</p><p>He continued: "The game has changed so much since I started out. That's the trouble with having been a darts baby: I look back and all my friends of yesteryear who I played with are gone.</p><p>"The way I've lived my life I should've been gone long ago but I'll continue plodding on, drinking, smoking, eating curries and probably getting in trouble with the law once or twice. I might even throw the odd dart or two."</p><p><i><b>*This article was crafted with the help of an AI tool, which speeds up Daily Star's editorial research.
