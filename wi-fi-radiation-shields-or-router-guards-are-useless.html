Likewise, Wi-Fi uses radio waves, which are a form of radiation. Despite what some snake oil salesmen may tell you, you don't need an EMF shield, "router guard," or "Wi-Fi radiation shield."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if you did want to remove Wi-Fi from your home (and you don't need to!), you'd be better off switching to a wired router and ditching all your Wi-Fi hardware. Skip the "router cages" and "router covers."</p><h2 id=blocking-wi-fi-radiation-means-blocking-wi-fi>"Blocking Wi-Fi Radiation" Means "Blocking Wi-Fi"</h2><p>EMF shields or wireless "router guards" promise to block Wi-Fi radiation. There's just one problem: "Wi-Fi radiation" just means "Wi-Fi radio waves."</p><p>That's not new, of course: AM and FM radio also use radio waves, for example. So do walkie-talkies, cordless telephones, wireless baby monitors, and many other common technologies that we've lived with for decades.</p><p>Since Wi-Fi is just radio waves (a type of radiation), blocking Wi-Fi radiation just means blocking Wi-Fi. If a router guard promises to "block 85% of Wi-Fi radiation," that's just another way of saying that it will make your wireless router operate at 15% efficiency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wi-fi-isn-t-dangerous>Wi-Fi Isn't Dangerous</h2><p>Wi-Fi radiation isn't dangerous to you. We encourage you to read our full explanation of <a href=#>why Wi-Fi radiation isn't dangerous</a>. In short, the dangerous type of radiation is ionizing radiation---like X-rays. Ionizing radiation has enough energy to "ionize" atoms and other molecules by knocking an electron out of their orbit.</p><p>However, Wi-Fi counts as "non-ionizing radiation"---like AM and FM radio. There is no scientific evidence that Wi-Fi radiation is dangerous, just as there's no evidence that the radio waves used by walkie-talkies (in other words, the radiation produced by walkie-talkies) are dangerous.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Don't Worry: Wi-Fi Isn't Dangerous</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-an-emf-shield-or-router-guard-do>What Does an EMF Shield or "Router Guard" Do?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/router-cage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These devices are a type of <a href=#>Faraday cage</a> that you place around your router. A Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks electromagnetic fields. That's why it's called an "EMF shield"---it functions as a shield against electromagnetic fields (EMFs).</p><p>This is a fancy way of saying that a "router guard" that you place around your router just interferes with the Wi-Fi signal, either weakening it dramatically or blocking it entirely.</p><p>Why would someone want to do this? Well, if they believed that Wi-Fi was dangerous, such a device might be valuable! But knowing that Wi-Fi isn't dangerous, we see that there is little point to such a device.</p><p>Such devices are unfortunately being widely advertised online, including on <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>. While we definitely believe in the right of everyone to buy these kinds of products if they want them---that's freedom, after all---we think you should know that these products are a waste of your money. Even if you believe the premise that Wi-Fi is dangerous, these Wi-Fi shields don't make much sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=again-wi-fi-is-just-radio-waves-which-are-radiation>Again, Wi-Fi Is Just Radio Waves, Which Are Radiation</h2><p>Wi-Fi is just radio waves, and radio waves are a type of radiation. A Wi-Fi router uses electromagnetic frequencies, also known as "radio waves" or "Wi-Fi radiation," to communicate with your devices and give them access to the internet. That's all it does.</p><p>Operating a Wi-Fi router and placing it in a Faraday cage is like setting up a radio broadcast tower and enclosing it in a cage that prevents people from receiving its signal. It doesn't make any sense.</p><h2 id=if-the-router-guard-works-it-makes-your-wi-fi-worse>If the Router Guard Works, It Makes Your Wi-Fi Worse</h2><p>If you look at the reviews for such devices on Amazon, you'll see many people leaving one-star reviews complaining that the Wi-Fi shield made their WI-Fi worse. Perhaps it now only works in the same room as the Wi-Fi router, when without the Faraday cage, the Wi-Fi offers a strong signal in every room in their home.</p><p>That's by design. That's how it works! It works by inhibiting your Wi-Fi signal. Less Wi-Fi radiation escapes the cage, which means that your Wi-Fi is weaker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-some-router-guards-promise-strong-wi-fi>But Some Router Guards Promise Strong Wi-Fi!</h2><p>If you click around and look at these products, you'll find that some router guards promise not to interfere with your Wi-Fi. They promise to reduce Wi-Fi radiation while giving you a strong signal. Some products might even have reviews saying, "This product works, unlike other router guards that made my Wi-Fi worse!"</p><p>How can this be?</p><p>Well, perhaps the manufacturer is lying and the router guard will actually make your Wi-Fi worse once you set it up.</p><p>However, if a particular router guard doesn't interfere with your Wi-Fi signal at all,&nbsp;that means that it isn't doing anything. It's not actually blocking radio waves (radiation) if it doesn't have any effect on your signal.</p><p>Perhaps one Wi-Fi EMF shield interferes less with Wi-Fi than another one. That just means that the radiation shield that gives you a better Wi-Fi signal is blocking less Wi-Fi radiation than the one giving you a weaker signal, which is blocking more Wi-Fi radiation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no free lunch. Wi-Fi is radio waves, which are radiation. Blocking Wi-Fi radiation means blocking your Wi-Fi signal. If you could block 100% of Wi-Fi radiation, you'd make your Wi-Fi router 100% useless.</p><h2 id=try-wired-internet-if-you-don-t-want-wi-fi>Try Wired Internet If You Don't Want Wi-Fi</h2><p>Even if Wi-Fi radiation were a concern---and we're not saying it is---a Wi-Fi EMF shield or "router guard" wouldn't make any sense as a product.</p><p>There are several options. Either you have an ineffective shield that gives you good Wi-Fi because it isn't actually blocking anything, an effective EMF shield that is so good that it prevents you from using Wi-Fi, or a shield that's somewhere in the middle, giving you a weak WI-Fi signal but still allowing some of that "Wi-Fi radiation" (in other words, the Wi-Fi signal) to escape the cage.</p><p>If you were concerned about this, you could ditch the Wi-Fi router and get a wired router where you connect your computers and other devices with Ethernet cables instead. You could then avoid using Wi-Fi and prevent your router from emitting any "Wi-Fi radiation" (in other words, Wi-Fi signal).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But you don't need to do any of this, because Wi-Fi isn't dangerous.</p><h2 id=or-try-the-national-radio-quiet-zone>Or Try the National Radio Quiet Zone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/telescope.jpg><p>Even if you didn't use your own Wi-Fi router, you would still be exposed to other forms of radio waves (radiation).&nbsp;For example, this includes Wi-Fi signals from your neighbors, cell phone signals, Bluetooth device communications, FM radio, AM radio, walkie-talkie signals, cordless phones, wireless baby monitors, and so on.</p><p>In the U.S., a good way to avoid a lot of this would be to move to <a href=#>the U.S. National Radio Quiet Zone</a>, a place in the country where most types of EMF radiation (including Wi-Fi and cell phone signals) are restricted to <a href=#>reduce disturbances</a> to sensitive equipment used for scientific research and military intelligence gathering in the area.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, you don't need to move there---because there's no evidence that these types of radiation are dangerous.</p><p>But if you did believe that radio waves were a problem, a router shield wouldn't be a good solution, because you'd only be dealing with a small part of the problem.
