Sarah explained she was also told to lose weight to make her more “marketable.” The incident happened at the beginning of her career while she was filming a <a href=#>movie</a> and she has now defied the unknown director by winning a Golden Globe. She was nominated at this year’s <a href=#>award show</a> in the Best Performance by a Female Actor on Television – Drama Series and took the accolade home.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1908169966-1024x674.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sarah-snook-says-she-was-body-shamed-by-a-producer>Sarah Snook says she was body-shamed by a producer</h2><p>The 36-year-old told The Sunday Times about the time an unnamed producer tore her down for eating chocolate cake on set during her early years in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> – in front of all of the cast and crew.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>: “One particular day, I had the tiniest bit of chocolate cake,’ she explained, stating that this led the producer to berate her in front of the entire cast and crew of the film.</p><p>“All the while I am dying inside.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Dark side of Miley Cyrus’ fame that affected her younger sister forever</a></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> continued by telling the publication the same person had told her she needed to lose some weight to have success in the entertainment industry. She was told she “wasn’t wanted” as she was “a nobody,” but was given the role because the director and writer believed her to be a good fit for the character she was playing.</p><p>“So, what we’ll do is change all of you so that you’re marketable,” Sarah explained, she was told. “We’ll whiten your teeth, darken your hair, we’ll give you a personal trainer so you can&nbsp;lose weight&nbsp;and look the part.”</p><p>This led her to believe she had to “be all the things that aren’t me” in order to thrive in her career.

Sarah couldn’t quite believe she’d received the award, beating the likes of Bella Ramsey, <a href=#>Emma Stone</a>, and Helen Mirren.</p><p>In her acceptance speech, she joked to the room, which was filled with the likes of <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>, Meryl Streep, and Leonardo DiCaprio was “intimidating.” She also said the drama had “changed her life.”</p><p>Sarah added: “Thank you Jesee for casting me, and Francine for putting me in front of Jesse. And this show, it’s changed my life. And everybody in it was amazing. The cast, the crew were fantastic. This is a team effort – it was always a team and that was what made it so amazing, I think, to be a part of.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kate Beckinsale’s Golden Globes night ended in the hospital as fans left concerned</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aCcL%2FAq5ihZaOjvLC3jLCYrGWUrravs4yipayhlJp6orLTnqlmmpWeu6h5waibsmWjna6uscNmpqdlo5rBcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html>Stay-at-home pregnant mom, 26, says meat only diet has given her an 'amazing body' and cured acne</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./roseanne-reboot-gender-creative-character-storyline-138196.html>Roseanne Reboot to Feature New Gender Creative Character</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./roseanne-reboot-gender-creative-character-storyline-138196.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
