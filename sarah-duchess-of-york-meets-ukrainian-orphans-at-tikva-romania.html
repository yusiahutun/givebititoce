They soon stopped moaning.</p><p id=eRHleIGMw_7D data-wc=56>“It was probably moaning at something like, 'Why are we watching Barbie and not watching something else', nothing serious," adds Sarah, who marked the girls’ 18th birthdays by taking them to a unit run by the Teenage Cancer Trust. "I wanted to teach them how to take the hand of a person who's dying," she explains.</p><h2>The Duchess visits Tikva</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2b8f61284a6-sarah-ferguson-duchess-york-meeting-baby.jpg><p id=eSwOSiTgGQVo data-wc=12>Sarah’s deep compassion was evident throughout the journey we shared with her.</p><p id=eLCTbaDh0J3c data-wc=59>There is an emotional reunion with new mother Vika, who first met the Duchess as a child in 2013 in Odessa, where she was photographed presenting her with a bunch of flowers. Now living in an apartment block for adult orphan refugees, Vika was delighted to see Sarah again – and to introduce her to her two-week-old son Pinchas.</p><p id=eH1TkmKKYGje data-wc=64>Picking the baby up for a cuddle, Sarah said: "I've seen children like Vika since she was very little when I went to Odessa in 2013, and she's now pushing a pram with her lovely husband and baby. So, this is hope, this is longevity, and this is the Rabbis and Tikva saying, 'You'll never be without us, we'll always be here for you.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/97c85021e5a6-sarah-ferguson-duchess-york-vika.jpg><p id=ei-KAIFt4tq5 data-wc=60>The Duchess also talked to Decebal, a housing developer who has provided the 230 new apartments, as well as office space which the charity has converted into an orphanage, Sarah says: "That is an extraordinarily kind generous act, I can't thank you enough.<strong>&nbsp;Why do you think you're so kind?” To which Decebal replies: "All the Romanians are like me".</strong></p><h2>Touring the orphanage and school</h2><p id=e84hWR8Lj3eW data-wc=20>At the orphanage, Tikva's community of children and alumni greeted the Duchess with an array of cheerful banners and flags.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/90c6b746bb64-duchess-sarah-ferguson-children.jpg><p id=evpumFji9hEX data-wc=55>"As you come through the gates, you feel Odessa, you feel the Ukrainian hope, the courage, the sense that one day we will get home, we will rebuild, and if not, until then this is their home - and it does feel like home,” she said. “There is that sense of 'You are not alone'."</p><p id=eGGqgsViJPNE data-wc=58>Sarah read a bedtime story to a group of young children gathered around her, and her maternal nature shone through. One little boy sat on her lap and showed her his toy sword, and he and the other children listened captivated as she read them the Princess and the Pea, and her own book, A Gift of Kindness.</p><p id=eeaWSxtKwieQ data-wc=32>On the second day of her visit, Sarah toured schools attended by around 500 orphans and children from the local community. She immediately put a nervous young girl called Eliana at ease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6b0f81233e18-sarah-ferguson-meeting-ukranian-refugees.jpg><p id=elKaX00mav1g data-wc=45><strong>"I started with 'hello' and she wrote 'hello' back. She copied my writing,"</strong> the Duchess told us. "I wrote 'I know you must be scared'. She didn't quite understand so someone translated it quickly, and then I drew a heart, and she drew a heart.</p><p id=er3vnVIrcatf data-wc=48>“I could feel the energy moving and shifting. It was seriously one of the most poignant moments of many, many years. It was very beautiful because it was drawing Eliana out of this tremendous fear, then at the end when she looked up at me… and that hug."</p><p id=eQVIp_aPTHWP data-wc=43>The young children in the kindergarten sang for her, the Duchess then handing out sweets and pencils with her famous 'Little Red' doll on top. “The little doll is so you know there is someone in England thinking of you," she tells them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b9f2261616af-sarah-ferguson-duchess-york-hug.jpg><h2>Supporting Tikva and the Jewish faith</h2><p id=ewIb-jr3iB4o data-wc=54>"It feels very wholesome to support Tikva," she shared. "By doing that you are supporting the Jewish faith globally and I feel strongly about that. You're uniting Rabbis all over the world to say, 'We're here, Tikva, you have hope' and we must spread awareness to fight for peace. It's such a beautiful message."</p><p id=e1CDN9cbSh-Y data-wc=44>The most striking thing about the Duchess is how much she cares - about children and adults alike. &nbsp;<strong>"Wherever I go in the world, I love people. I'm a communicator, I love to learn from other people, I love to feel it,"</strong> said Sarah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2563b4dfa7c9-sophie-hamilton-sarah-ferguson-tikva-charity-trip.jpg><p id=eDwnqyQeGVvI data-wc=48>"I speak from the heart, because I can't imagine what it must be like to not know how you're going to feed your child. So, when I go to these extraordinary places like Tikva, when I'm in the field and working, I'm solely there.
