In 8th grade, when his family moved to Seoul and he struggled to adjust to the new environment, once again it was sports that allowed Yun to make a name for himself. Sports like that have always been his blueprint to fame. Still, never did he thought that in this passionate journey, he would one day be dubbed the first Asian to win a medal in skeleton or, the first Korean Winter Olympic medalist from non-skating sports.</p><p>But more recently, it’s a different kind of history he is trying to make. South Korea’s “Iron Man” years after claiming a historic gold in men’s skeleton at PyeongChang in 2018 has found himself participating as one of the contestants in Physical 100&nbsp;in 2023. So, here’s our exclusive attempt to tell you all about his parents, net worth, girlfriend, and more.</p><h3><strong>Yun Sung-bin On Physical 100</strong></h3><p>Episode 1 of the Squid Game like seeming reality show saw 100 fitness fanatics of all shapes and sizes come to one place and get acquainted with one another in a room filled with casts of their torsos. Yun Sung-bin was one of them. As soon as he walked in, was approved of his ripped physique by fellow competitors. One even passed a comment that his muscles were seemingly going to rip through his shirt. Another said he gave this vibe like “a beast was walking in”.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the fans watching all of it took no long time to recognize him as a big name in South Korean households.</p><p>Yun, if you don’t already know, was listed as one of Forbes Asia’s “30 Under 30 for Entertainment and Sports” in 2018. The star in the rising is also no stranger to TV. He was seen in the variety show, Running Man.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Yun Sung-bin Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Yun Sung-bin reportedly had close to $1 million net worth as of 2023. If he is to win the Physical 100&nbsp;competition in first place, he will also be taking with him the 300 million won cash prize besides the title of “most perfect physique”. In that case, he will also be really celebrating as just last year he was really disappointed as he could not find Olympic form at the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games.</p><p>Yun has been carving his spot into skeleton history for years. Until 2022, he had reached the podium at two world championships and 37 world cups, winning 10 world cup gold medals, having taken the No. 2 spot in 2016, 2017, and 2019 and the No. 1 spot in 2018.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Yun Sung-bin?</strong></h3><p>Yun Sung-bin was born in 1994. So, he turned 28 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Yun Sung-bin Parents?</strong></h3><p>It appears Yun Sung-bin’s mother, Cho Young-hee has been a big support in his life/career. Racing down a 1,335-meter slide when he cried as he experienced his first ride down the track in Park City, Utah in his final year of high school, it was her he called. His mother recalls the day even today of how surprised she was when her son, who never displayed his true feelings even through adversity, called with such uncertainty. “Think it over one more time and then decide on what you truly want to do. I will always respect your decision”, she had consoled him.</p><p>Looking at her son over the years, the matriarch also once told Korea JoongAng Daily, that she learned a lot from her son. Before she considered him just her son but, after some time he thought he also represents the country now. She gushed that through mature Sung-bin, she feels like she is getting more mature.</p><p>When Yun first told Cho about the skeleton, she was strongly against it as she considered the sport to be really dangerous. But, once his teacher told her that it will have greater meaning if he tries something that the others don’t, she trusted her son of course. And looking back she is glad she made that choice.</p><p>Yun’s mom and younger sister have often been seen praying for him during his games from the stands. The year her son won the gold medal at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, she said&nbsp;she tried to only look at gold-colored objects wherever she went.</p><p>As for Yun’s father, not even his name was known at the time of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Yun Sung-bin Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Yun Sung-bin, who had celebrities congratulate him on his Olympics win, did not seem to be dating anyone of them.</p><p>By the time of this writing, Yun Sung-bin’s relationship status was unclear. If he had been married, he did not talk about it in Physical 100. And if he had been dating anyone since filming the show, he also did not reveal that.</p><p>So, until January 2023, Yun managed to keep his marital life completely private. Not even his social media could tell us about his present or past love affairs. There was simply no evidence of a girlfriend or a wife on his socials.</p><h3><strong>Yun Sung-bin Height</strong></h3><p>When also tattoo-loving Yun Sung-bin was on the national team in 2012 he stood at 1.78 meters in height and weighed around 76 kg.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Yun Sung-bin Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yun Sung-bin’s birthday is on May 23rd and that makes him a Gemini.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Yun Sung-bin On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indeed. Yun Sung-bin could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@top.physical</a>, where he entertained&nbsp;60 posts and 48.8K followers as of 28 January 2023.</p><p>Besides, Yun was followed by 46,987 amazing supporters on his ‘Yun Sungbin’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>&nbsp;and he also happens to have a fan account (@godsungbin) on Instagram.</p><p>Not to miss, since his joining in May 2020, he has also managed to invite over 228K subscribers to his YouTube channel (<a href=#>@ironbin</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmsq2eYsC2usZmmaKmXZy2s7jFq6CeppRivaK%2BxKerrGWemsFuw86rq6FloJ3GtLXCmqNmaWBlfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-parents-net-worth-physical-100.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-parents-net-worth-physical-100.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-parents-net-worth-physical-100.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-parents-net-worth-physical-100.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-parents-net-worth-physical-100.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-parents-net-worth-physical-100.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./seven-year-itch-first-survive-seven-month-slouch-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./seven-year-itch-first-survive-seven-month-slouch-html.html>Seven-year itch?
