Never miss important updates</strong></p><h2>Early life</h2><p class=align-left>Masoud Shojaee was born on August 3, 1959, in Tehran, Iran. Not much is known about his life growing up, as he did not attract much public interest until years later when he became successful in the US. However, he likely spent his childhood in Iran, where he also received elementary and secondary education.</p><p class=align-left>Shojaee's father was pretty successful and owned a construction company in Iran, which the government contracted on various projects. He was likely meant to succeed his father, but trouble started brewing in the 1970s due to strikes and growing public unrest.</p><p class=align-left>When the Iranian revolution started in 1978, Shojaee left his home country, travelling to the US to attend college. Initially, he intended to attend UCLA. However, his friends convinced him to attend the University of Miami, where he pursued a degree in electrical engineering.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bdcffdeaeb97876d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Miguel Gomez (actor): net worth, wife, height, children, movies and shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After leaving Iran, the situation deteriorated in the country, with <a href=#>many businesses</a> suffering. On top of that, Shojaee's father retired, which made returning home to take over the <a href=#>business</a> hard. As a result, he furthered his studies, obtaining a master's degree and taking additional classes towards a PhD. After completing his studies, he decided to set up roots in Miami.</p><h2>Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4d3e4dd519b0118.png><p class=align-left>When Shojaee left for the US, he carried a nest egg to fund his lifestyle. On top of that, when his father retired, he sent more money, leaving him with a tidy sum that he could invest. He chose to invest in real estate industry.</p><p class=align-left>Lucky for him, the market was just ripe; the US was going through a saving and loans crisis, making it a great time to acquire properties. To start with, he partnered with another <a href=#>real development company</a>, A&F Developer, their first project being a 48-home property. It was successful and completely sold out, leading to a second 58-lot development project.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b099b84f833e4f1f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mizkif: real name, girlfriend, net worth, ethnicity, nationality</span></p></a><h3>Shoma Development</h3><p class=align-left>After the first two successful projects, Shojaee struck out on his own, founding the real estate company Shoma Development in 1988. Initially, the company focused on developing mid-range priced properties, mostly single-family homes and townhouses. The tactic worked, and the company became very successful.</p><p class=align-left>Shoma Development changed tactics in 2007 after noticing changing market trends. As a result, they ventured into luxurious homes and townhouses. The company also expanded its reach and started developing properties in areas such as Palm Beach, Broward, and other regions of South Florida. Furthermore, the company started developing office buildings and other commercial properties.</p><p class=align-left>Today, Shoma (now Shoma Group) is one of the largest real estate development companies in South Florida. Shojaee is the company's chief executive officer and the chairman of its board of directors.</p><h3>Aviation industry</h3><p class=align-left>Aside from real estate, Shojaee has dabbled in the aviation industry. In 2003, he started buying and selling helicopters and planes and was quite successful despite the 2008 economic crisis. Occasionally, he still buys and sells aeroplanes, but his main focus is on his <a href=# title>real estate </a>empire.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/67f041c609cff5d5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gerardo Gabriel biography: wife, height, weight, net worth</span></p></a><h2>Masoud Shojaee's wife</h2><p class=align-left>Shojaee is married to Stephanie Shojaee, formerly Stephanie Mejia.
