As far back as 2011, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>experts have emphasized</a> that we can't shop our way out of this enormous problem â€” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nocaes">it will take government action</a> to force profiting companies away from the activities leading to our planet's demise. But if you still want to make sure your skincare routine isn't supporting the fossil fuel industry, the good news is there are tons of options that use only sustainable ingredients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Countless crude oil-derived petrochemicals are used in skincare, but the most obvious ones to look out for are petrolatum, petroleum, petroleum jelly, paraffin, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>mineral oil</a>. Other common culprits are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>ethylene, propylene, and butadiene</a>, along with any <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>ingredients ending in -eth</a>, which means they're created with the petrochemical ethylene oxide (same with PEGs).

Switching isn't going to solve our global predicament, but abandoning the ingredients can effectively tell companies we're done supporting those that wreck the world. (That said, the most sustainable path is finishing whatever you have on hand before cracking open a more eco-friendly product).

Unlike harsh exfoliants that can end up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>damaging your skin barrier</a>, the Texture Smoothing Cream relies on supportive ingredients like antioxidant-rich flax and celery extract, fatty acid-depositing tsubaki seed oil, and squalane to smooth skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gamechanger.

Another person writes that they were thinking of getting Botox before integrating the moisturizer into their routine, and now won't even consider it â€” their wished-for smoothing is done.

Two forms of vitamin C, vitamin E, sea buckthorn oil, and tara pod extract are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>behind the radiance activation</a>, which shoppers say is significant and fast-acting. "My face has never felt so moisturized or soft. The sunspot over my lip is fading," says someone of the effects they saw in two weeks. "And bonus, my forehead wrinkles are less obvious."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another person writes: "Amazing results from the very first use.

Concurrent with the theme, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PlantGenius Melt Moisturizer's formula</a> leaves skin petal soft (leaves, eh?

The mix is especially well-suited for those with oily skin, according to reviewers: "I wanted a light moisturizer for aging skin, and I got it," one person writes.

I have very dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin. The texture is thick and creamy, but it does not break me out like other thick creams," one person writes.

It's pricey, but one or two drops per use means it lasts and lasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong> $40</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-at-the-drugstore-honest-beauty-hydrogel-cream></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best at the Drugstore: Honest Beauty Hydrogel Cream</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If all this talk of $72 moisturizers has your wallet feeling frail, I've got you â€” or rather, Jessica Alba's got you. The actress's Honest Beauty skincare line is just as good as the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mascara</a>, and at $20 flat, the paraben-, silicone-, petrolatum-, mineral oil-, synthetic fragrance-, and dye-free formula ensures anyone can find skincare that doesn't contribute to the oil industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Hydrogel cream fittingly combines a gel texture with ample moisture, for results that impress even self-proclaimed "skincare fanatics."

"It absorbs perfectly â€” feels like my skin is drinking it up, instead of leaving greasiness.

I prioritized multi-tasking skincare, and while I'm now more open to layering (especially since so many moisturizer-SPF duos use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>chemical sunscreens that I avoid</a>), Kari Gran's moisturizing sunscreen means I don't have to carve out time for a multi-step routine. I've tried some truly excellent sunscreens in my years of product testing, but <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>the brand's Natural Essential SPF 28</a> is in my top three of all time, if not number one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The classy black bottle doesn't give much away re:the formula, but once you give it a good shake, out comes a milky fluid that deeply moisturizes as it protects skin with non-nano zinc oxide. Non-GMO red raspberry seed oil, plum seed oil, macadamia nut oil, kukui seed oil, avocado oil, jojoba oil, organic beeswax, and vitamin E oil mean the zinc easily smoothes over skin, creating a veil of sunscreen and antioxidants. It's so moisturizing that my skin feels plump and hydrated no matter how much salt I eat, and that's a lot. One hundred stars out of five, and no problematic ingredients to speak of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong> $47</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLKku8WroJ6mlKHGbrzEramom5iauqqvwKVkn6qVmnquu8isq66qma%2Bysw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fecofriendly-petrochemical-free-moisturizer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fecofriendly-petrochemical-free-moisturizer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fecofriendly-petrochemical-free-moisturizer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fecofriendly-petrochemical-free-moisturizer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fecofriendly-petrochemical-free-moisturizer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fecofriendly-petrochemical-free-moisturizer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eminem-in-talks-to-buy-detroit-venue.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eminem-in-talks-to-buy-detroit-venue.html>Eminem In Talks To Buy Detroit Venue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./police-suspect-drove-stolen-atv-into-oncoming-traffic-ran-from-police.html>Police: Suspect drove stolen ATV into oncoming traffic, ran from police</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./police-suspect-drove-stolen-atv-into-oncoming-traffic-ran-from-police.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
