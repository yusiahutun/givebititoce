In recent times, because she advanced into the coveted ‘Top 20’ performing “Somebody to Love” by Queen, we thought of telling you who the man in her life is.</p><h3><strong>American Idol: Meet Matheus Telles, Hannah Nicolaisen Fiance</strong></h3><p>Matheus Telles has been with Hannah Nicolaisen for more than four years. They celebrated their fourth anniversary on 15 May 2022 and that year in December they also got engaged. It seems in June of the same year, Matheus also took Hannah to his hometown to meet his family, or maybe see them again.</p><p>Hannah is head over heels in love with the man and vice-versa, it seems.</p><p>On 18 April 2023, after voting was closed for Hawaii, Hannah thanked everyone, her fans, mentors, and the team of people who made sure when she was taken care of when she tested positive for COVID the day before she was supposed to fly to Hawaii. And finally, when it was time to talk about Matheus, she said she is so excited to share this life with him.</p><p>Hannah particularly thanked him for helping her learn about herself, for supporting me, for being her safe place and her light. She said, when she saw the American Idol link for auditions, she almost did not click out of fear, but it was him who gave her the confidence she needed. When she was unsure of her song choices, it was he who reminded her of her purpose. And with that, she concluded that had it not been for him, she could not have made it this far.</p><h3><strong>Matheus Telles Age</strong></h3><p>Matheus Telles was born before 1997. So, he should have maybe reached the age of 26 at the least.</p><h3><strong>Matheus Telles Family</strong></h3><p>Matheus Telles comes from a family of four.</p><p>His mother is Cecilia Telles, who on her <a href=#>Facebook</a> mentioned living in Taboão da Serra municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil and working at&nbsp;CEEP.</p><p>Then, there is Maíra Telles (on IG <a href=#>@maira.telless</a>), his seemingly only sibling.</p><p>Other family members are Angela Antunes Telles of São Paulo, Brazil, Ricardo Telles of Taboão da Serra, and Clemente Antunes Telles of São Paulo, Brazil.</p><h3><strong>Is Matheus Telles On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Matheus Telles can be found on Instagram. As of 24 April 2023, his IG <a href=#>@tellessss</a>, which was private included 200 posts and 1,148 followers.</p><p>Other than that, one could give Matheus a follow on his ‘Matheus Telles’ Facebook and on his self-titled YouTube channel.</p><h3><strong>Matheus Telles Job</strong></h3><p>Per LinkedIn, Matheus Telles had been working as a seasonal head coach for the Boys’ Soccer team at The Montgomery Academy, since June 2022.</p><p>Besides, on his IG BIO, he also mentioned being associated with Cowley Co. and Faulkner University as their assistant coach.</p><p>In a Facebook post from back in 2018, Matheus was offering private soccer lessons for that summer for kids who liked and wanted to learn more about soccer.</p><p>All of these, in a way, explain what brought him and Hannah together in the first place, as she recently said again that sport is still all she thinks of all the time. Of course, it is music now. On the Idol stage, she shared how finding music has filled a void. Also, from the show we got to know that she works as a recruiter when she is not singing.</p><p>A couple of years back, when Hannah was in Cypress Woods she played Volleyball. She appeared in 80 matches during her UIS career, ended her career ranked tenth in program history in total blocks, and in between was top-10 in the team’s NCAA era with 650 kills, 781 points, and 186 blocks.</p><p>Speaking of her journey on Season 21 of American Idol, she started it off by auditioning in New Orleans. She sang “Make You Feel My Love” by Bob Dylan and three judges voted “yes”. She chose to work on her Songwriting in the first part of Hollywood Week and her original song “Going Through the Motions”. In the following rounds, she sang songs like “Glitter in the Air” by P!nk and “I Don’t Want to Be” by Gavin DeGraw.</p><h3><strong>Matheus Telles Education</strong></h3><p>For high school, Matheus Telles went to E.E. Jornalista Wandyck Freitas. From there, he attended Cowley College from August 2015 – May 2017.</p><p>Between August 2015 and 2020, Matheus also studied for his Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Sciences at Faulkner University. Then, at the same university, he did his Master of Science in Management with Business Analytics Emphasis (August 2021 – May 2023).
