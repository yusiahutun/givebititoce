She was swinging the largest iteration of Loewe’s Origami bag, but what stood out to me were her boots: Cut from chocolate leather, they each had a floppy faux waistband complete with belt loops, button, and fly. The effect was that of a woman who had woken up, draped herself in glamorous leather layers—and then pulled her pants down around her ankles before strutting out the door.</p><img alt="paris, france march 03 a model walks the runway during the loewe ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the paris fashion week on march 3, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Loewe - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024 Paris Fashion Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-bag-pant-boots-65a84a6a10ecc.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>A model at Loewe’s Fall 2023 show in an all-leather look with the brand’s pants-like Toy boots</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We are now nearly a month into 2024, not quite a year later, and I cannot stop thinking about those boots. And it’s not just about how quietly chaotic they are, either. Yes, I’m impressed by the way Jonathan Anderson was able to make something so inherently silly feel so swanky. (Being pantsed never looked so opulent!) But I’m more curious as to what’s going on with pants in general. Like, are they okay?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pants have been having an existential crisis for over half a decade now, ever since Gen Z started wielding the word <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thecut.com/2021/05/cheugy-is-hard-to-define-but-easy-to-identify.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=cheugy class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">cheugy</a> like a knife. Skinny jeans were dead and low-rise jeans the future, a claim that sent a shiver down the internet’s collective spine, resulting in multiple millennial meltdowns. And don’t even think about throwing on a dress over a pair of pants unless you want to stir the pot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anderson didn’t stir the pot; he just made another one entirely. Loewe’s tall Toy pants boot has the enviable slouch of your favorite pair of jeans, along with all the details you’d expect from a five-pocket trouser. Key loops encircle the top of the calf, and there’s zigzag stitching around the zipperless fly. The shorter Toy doesn’t drape in the same way, but it does have a large (perhaps functional?) pocket near the ankle. The flat Toy boot has both pocket details and excess leather pooling around the heels.</p><img alt="emily ratajkowski at loewe ready to wear spring 2024 held at esplanade saint louis on september 29, 2023 in paris, france photo by swan galletwwd via getty images" title="Loewe Ready To Wear Spring 2024 - Front Row" width=2667 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/em-rata-loewe-boots-65a849930225e.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty</span><p>Emily Ratajkowski in no pants and Loewe’s boots that look like pants at the brand’s Spring 2024 show in September</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Miu Miu last February, Mrs. Prada deemed pants entirely irrelevant by sending models down the runway in embellished crystal panties.

At Y/Project, Glenn Martens made <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/men/yproject-cowboy-high-cuff-jeans-item-20262135.aspx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oversize jeans" data-vars-ga-product-id=1e8413de-03db-470f-bbde-43934fba0c58 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/men/yproject-cowboy-high-cuff-jeans-item-20262135.aspx data-product-url=https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/men/yproject-cowboy-high-cuff-jeans-item-20262135.aspx data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1eddf209-a4e6-4e8d-b464-32e4dd37c14f class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">oversize jeans</a> that appeared to be layered under tall denim cowboy boots—except the “boots” were actually just cowboy-boot-shaped panels, which could be removed to transform the pants into shorts. At Bottega, Matthieu Blazy designed leather pants that looked exactly like denim. And Anderson didn’t stop with the Loewe pants boots. In September, he debuted an impossibly high-waisted pair of pants that reached halfway up the rib cage.</p><img alt="paris, france march 07 a model walks the runway during the miu miu ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the paris fashion week on march 7, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Miu Miu - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024 Paris Fashion Week" width=2832 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miu-miu-panties-65aaef6de82e5.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>A model in Miu Miu’s bedazzled panties—beautiful in theory, but slightly unwieldy in practice</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Everyone loves to toss around phrases like quiet luxury or back to basics or It’s the recession to describe this pared-back style moment, but there’s nothing quiet about what’s happening to pants.

He told reporters the look was “subversive” but still “civilized.” In an age of naked dressing, the models were fully clothed—technically, the surface area of their bodies was more covered in pants than usual.</p><img alt="paris, france september 29 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the loewe womenswear springsummer 2024 show as part of paris fashion week on september 29, 2023 in paris, france photo by pascal le segretaingetty images" title="Loewe : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Spring/Summer 2024" width=3474 height=5212 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-high-pants-2-65aaef95da33e.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pascal Le Segretain</span><p>A model at Loewe’s Spring 2024 show in a new, impossibly high pants silhouette</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In practice, pants are just fabric tubes for legs. They’ve been an outfit anchor for decades—something you don’t have to think about too much. Socially, we’re expected to wear pants, and we mostly oblige. That might be why deviating from the original design seems to get people really worked up: It feels truly disruptive. Being caught with no pants on is, after all, a prototypical nightmare. But maybe as fashion gets a little more tame, pants have been given the opportunity to let loose.</p><img alt="a woman posing for a picture" title="a woman posing for a picture" width=1024 height=1535 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sa-2-1669910274-65a845b34143b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Sarah Aphrodite</span><p>One-legged pants by independent designer Sarah Aphrodite</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I can’t wait to see what inflammatory pants discourse will happen next. Will the skirt-over-pants trend make it to the mainstream? Will no-pants will become the new pants? What other non-pants items will designers make to look like pants? Seeing what happens to pants is one of the things I’m most excited about this year, mostly because the internet prophets have said 2024 gives “2014 vibes.” We’re only 22 days in, but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46423435/kylie-jenner-cotton-candy-pink-hair/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="King Kylie has already returned" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">King Kylie has already returned</a>, which means we can’t be more than a couple of weeks away from disco pants and ripped stockings replacing High Sport, right? Clearly, the stage has been more than set for pants that are more fun. The options all are there—and it feels like this just might be the year people start wearing them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe I should disclose my own biases: Pants make me nervous. Sometimes I find them too practical, too bland. They don’t excite me like other staples in my wardrobe. In 2024, though, I might give them a shot, because for the first time in a while, “wearing the pants” doesn’t evoke just one image. And who doesn’t want to be the kind of person who wears the pants (boot) in a relationship?</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
