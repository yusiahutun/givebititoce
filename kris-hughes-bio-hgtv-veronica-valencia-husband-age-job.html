Here we discuss his husband, age, job, and other details in this article below.</p><p>So, tag along and learn more as this piece proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Meet Kris Hughes, HGTV Veronica Valencia Husband</strong></h3><p>HGTV Veronica Valencia met her husband 11 years ago in New York City and they fell in love almost immediately. Their path crossed when they were working on a design show. “He was the show’s production manager,” Veronica shared with HGTV. “When the show ended, I said, ‘Come to Los Angeles, and I promise we can get on a show together!'”</p><p>Three months into dating, Veronica had to return to her hometown of Los Angeles, California. On their last dinner before she left, “we talked about our future plans, we ate great seafood in the city and we talked about how we both always felt our guardian angels around us.”</p><p>Not long after, they became business partners with Design Hunters. Veronica added, “The best part of working together is that Kris and I have so much combined professional experience. The hard part now is managing our professional lives and being parents. I don’t remember the last time we went on a date night!”</p><p>On Kris’s birthday in January 2023, Veronica wished her husband: “Happy Birthday Kristopher 🤎 Thank you for being so easy to love. The best decision I ever made. Cheers to the life we have built together… cheers to our two beautiful children… and cheers to YOU my love. The amazing New Yorker who is not only tough and loyal but sensitive and chivalrous. I love your beautiful caring heart. Always and forever. <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@mr.kristopher</a>.”</p><p>They got engaged in July 2015. The engaged couple eventually married on <a href=#>11 November 2016</a> in Malibu. On their 6th wedding anniversary and ten years together, Veronica gushed on the day of her anniversary: “10 years together, 6 years married & 2 beautiful children. This man is literally my dream come true. My New Yorker 🥺 Every time Hunter asks me to tell him about our love story I get giddy and butterflies all over again…. The story about the girl from California, who met the boy from New York will forever be my favorite love story. 📖 ✨ I love you, Kristopher.”</p><p>The married couple share two children a son, Hunter Hughes (<a href=# rel=noopener>born</a> October 30, 2018), and a daughter, River Beaux Hughes (<a href=# rel=noopener>born</a> September 2, 2021).</p><p>Veronica also publicly shared a memorable moment with her son. “Hunter [my son] knew I was nervous prior to an appearance on <i>Rock the Block</i>,” says Veronica. “He asked, ‘Why are you so scared?’ and I replied, ‘Because a lot of people are going to see Mommy on television.’ And then he said, ‘Don’t worry Mom. They’re not going to <i>like</i>&nbsp;you, they’re going to&nbsp;<i>love</i>&nbsp;you because you’re fun and amazing and a really good mom.’”</p><p>Veronica was 6 years old, she picked out new paint colors for the exterior of her family’s home. “From an early age, I loved design,” Veronica told HGTV. “My dad and I would drive around looking at model homes on the weekends because I was fascinated by their staging and architecture. We would pretend we were interested in buying a house just so I could get in and have a look.”</p><p>Veronica is the oldest of four children of <a href=#>Anita and Armando Valencia</a> born on 11 September 1985. She worked as a television production designer before renovating homes. Veronica, who is based in Los Angeles and New York, served as the MLB Fan Cave’s production designer and creative director in 2011.</p><p>Over 500 home improvement programs on OWN, Fox, NBC, and other networks required her to labor in the background early in her career. She also contributed between 2008 and 2012 to the popular ABC home improvement program Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. She co-founded Go Team Ghana with designers from that show in order to construct a recreation facility for young Ghanaians.</p><h3><strong>Kris Hughes Age</strong></h3><p>Kris Hughes turned 38 years old in 2023.
