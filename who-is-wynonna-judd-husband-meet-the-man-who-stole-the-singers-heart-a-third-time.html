<time>06 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Married thrice, Wynonna Judd found happiness with her current husband, who has stood by her through the toughest times.</strong></p><p>Wynonna Judd is proud of her husband of ten years Cactus Moser. The star, who survived two previous marriages before Moser, has been open about how much she enjoys her life with her third husband, whom she considers her support system.</p><p>In October 2022, the songstress gushed about her husband, and how his support has helped her survive the direst situations, including the loss of her mom and musical partner, Naomi Judd. She <a href=#>told</a> interviewers:</p><p><strong>“He’s the most tough and tender man I’ve ever been with that I trust. We are so connected. It’s crazy how connected we are. I trust him with my life, which I can’t always say that about the men in my life.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230125_212531.jpg><p>In the same interview, the 58-year-old described her husband as her support system. No doubt Wynonna Judd holds her husband in high esteem, but who is this wonderful man who has earned so much praise from the legendary crooner</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_The_Husband_Of_Wynonna_Judd></span><strong>Who Is The Husband Of Wynonna Judd?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wynonna Judd is married to four-time CMA winner <a href=#>Cactus Moser</a>. Born on May 3, 1957, the multi-instrumentalist and musician grew up nurturing his musical talents, with a flair for drumming.</p><p>Moser is a Colorado native, who played with the band, Highway 101, for over two decades, shooting off his career. Notably, he makes the bulk of his earnings as a successful soundtrack composer.</p><p>Aside from drumming, Cactus works as a producer and writer. He is also a member of his wife’s band, Wynonna and the Big Noise, where he lends his drumming inputs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Wynonna_Judds_Husband_Lose_His_Leg></span><strong>How Did Wynonna Judd’s Husband Lose His Leg?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One distinguishing feature many may notice in Judd’s husband is the absence of his left leg, which has sparked curiosity among many. Notably, the star lost his left leg following a life-threatening <a href=#>motorcycle accident</a> in August 2012, two months after his marriage to Judd.</p><p>Judd once recounted the life-changing accident. Per the songstress, they were riding on separate bikes on that fateful day, when Cactus’ motorcycle crashed into an oncoming vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Wynonna-Judd-Is-Married.jpeg><p>She recalled staring at her husband as he lay unconscious on the floor without making a sound. Thankfully, her worst fears passed when she heard him breathe, something she now describes as the most beautiful sound on earth.</p><p>The accident caused severe damage to his limbs, leading to the amputation of his left leg right above the knee. Yet, the singer did not let that hold him back.</p><p>Within months of his accident, the star hit the road again, dishing out magical beats from his drum set while on a multi-city tour. Additionally, he harnessed his accident for good, joining the Steps of Faith Foundation.</p><p>He has since served as an advocate for the foundation, aimed at delivering working limbs to amputees, who are unable to afford the medical expenses themselves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wynonna_Judd_And_Her_Husband_Cactus_Mosers_Relationship></span><strong>Wynonna Judd And Her Husband Cactus Moser’s Relationship</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The country singer Wynonna Judd first met her husband in the eighties, while on a tour with The Judds, a band she and her late mom Naomi Judd championed.</p><p>However, the two only started dating in 2009, after Judd’s second divorce. Moser proposed in December 2011 and the two tied the knot in June 2012.</p><p>Their nuptials took place at the songstress farm in Leiper’s Fork, Tennessee, in the presence of Wynonna Judd and Moser’s children. Notably, neither Wynonna Judd’s mom, Naomi Judd, nor her sister, Ashley Judd attended the ceremony. This heightened the rumours of an ongoing feud between the Judd sisters and perhaps, their mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230125_212512.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Wynonnas_Previous_Husbands></span><strong>Who Are Wynonna’s Previous Husbands?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before marrying her husband Cactus Moser, Wynonna Judd <a href=#>exchanged vows with two other men</a>, both of which ended in divorce.</p><p>Her story with her first husband Arch Kelly began following their meeting in 1993. They welcomed their first child together, Elijah in 1994. Two years later, the twosome tied the knot and expanded their family with the birth of their daughter, Grace.</p><p>Judd’s daughter with Kelly was sentenced to eight years behind bars in 2018 for violating probation. Meanwhile, their marriage ended in divorce in 1999.</p><p>In 2003, Judd walked down the aisle again, this time, with her longtime bodyguard D.R. Roach. Four years into their marriage, Roach was arrested on charges of child sex assault and battery.</p><p>The star filed for divorce from her second husband three days after his arrest, citing irreconcilable differences. Via her website, Judd cited the sex assault scandal, admitting she felt devastated.</p><p>However, she resolved to move forward from it, and focus on healing, and saving herself and her kids from the difficult situation.</p><p>She spent the years that followed doing just that while growing her music career. Those efforts eventually paid off for Wynonna Judd, who not only <a href=#>built a massive empire</a> with a staggering net worth but also became hitched to the real love of her life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZq%2Bpo7yvusBmoa6clGK1tr%2FBmqWdZZ2asrV506GcZqWRo3q4tM5mqq2nnJp6tbTEZqqippeav7R5x56Yq6xdlnq1tMirm2asmaKycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-wynonna-judd-husband-meet-the-man-who-stole-the-singers-heart-a-third-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-wynonna-judd-husband-meet-the-man-who-stole-the-singers-heart-a-third-time.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-wynonna-judd-husband-meet-the-man-who-stole-the-singers-heart-a-third-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-wynonna-judd-husband-meet-the-man-who-stole-the-singers-heart-a-third-time.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-wynonna-judd-husband-meet-the-man-who-stole-the-singers-heart-a-third-time.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-wynonna-judd-husband-meet-the-man-who-stole-the-singers-heart-a-third-time.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eugenio-derbez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eugenio-derbez.html>Eugenio Derbez</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./black-lingerie.html>The sexiest black lingerie to shop now: From Boux Avenue to Agent Provocateur &amp;amp; more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./black-lingerie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
