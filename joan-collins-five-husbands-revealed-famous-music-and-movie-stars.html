Throughout his decade-spanning career, Maxwell starred in (1947), (1948), (1952) and (1957-1960).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b96a8b2804cc-joan-collins-husband-maxwell-wedding.jpg><p id=epIDXeml8vK data-wc=36>Maxwell first met Joan when she was 17, and he proposed after just a few months of dating. However, they got divorced after four years of marriage in 1956 and Maxwell died from cancer in 1974.&nbsp;</p><p id=egcMt4B5tDd data-wc=69>Joan has since opened up about their unhappy union and claimed he drugged and sexually assaulted her on their first date. She said in podcast that she then felt obligated to marry him. "It wasn't my fault but I didn't know, I went out with him. And maybe I shouldn't have gone out with him. He was much older than me, and he was a famous star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e8c0c3643fce-joan-collins-and-maxwellreed.jpg><p id=eQ_XazBXhZC data-wc=35>"And anyway the bottom line is that he called me, and I went out with him again. And after I'd been going out with him for a few months, he asked me to marry him.</p><p id=eW6Tv0v2G7r data-wc=34>"And I thought, 'Well I better because you know, he took my virginity.' I really hated him, but I was so filled with guilt, that he had done this thing to me," she explained.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Anthony Newley</h3><p id=ekerjbzfIHp data-wc=59>Joan's second marriage was to the late Anthony Newley – an English actor and singer-songwriter who was hailed as "One of Broadway's greatest leading men." Among his many accomplishments, Anthony wrote the iconic song 'Feeling Good' which would become a hit for Nina Simone, and he also created the film score for (1971).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/af2146aa34f0-joan-collins-and-anthony-newly.jpg><p id=eilA9qNKHyX data-wc=55>Anthony and Joan married in 1963, and they later welcomed two children – &nbsp;Tara Newley and Alexander (Sacha) Newley. Six years after their wedding, however, the couple's relationship broke down as a result of Anthony's infidelity on the set of his autobiographical film –</p><p id=eKXiRkotfuy data-wc=54>During an appearance at Kite Festival in June 2023, Joan opened up about her second marriage, telling crowds: "He was wonderful, that was Anthony Newley. We had two great children. He was fabulous until he went off to make a movie about his life in which he went to bed with about 72 women.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/d83ed0a68533-joan-collins-anthony-newley-at-premiere.jpg><p id=eZOWkUsMOh5 data-wc=45>"I went to see it at a private screening. I knew that there was something going on when Barbra Streisand was singing to him at one of our parties, like looking up into his eyes, and I found out later they had had an affair.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1CLY-h3TYl data-wc=28>"He was a serial womaniser. I was then 35 and I thought, 'I can't live like this' with a man who is going to do that," she concluded.</p><p id=e6g2ZWxC3xAa data-wc=15>Anthony passed away on 14 April 1999 from renal cancer at the age of 67.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Ronald S. Kass</h3><p id=eR9dfdU0w6_C data-wc=58>American businessman and recording executive, Ronald 'Ron' Kass, is internally recognised as the former manager of The Beatles (a position that Allen Klein would later occupy). Following his departure from Apple Records – the label set up by The Beatles – Ron turned to film producing and worked on (1971), (1973), and (1978).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/843a0280b792-joan-collins-and-ron-krass.jpg><p id=ee1t_nwuOsdm data-wc=38>His marriage to Joan came in 1972, shortly before they welcomed their daughter Katyana (known as Katy). In an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Mail Online</a>, Joan described the three years after their wedding as "among the happiest in my life."&nbsp;</p><p id=eG79NWFMXSVH data-wc=45>Unfortunately, the couple had turbulent times ahead after moving to LA, where Ron started a film company with a partner — Edgar Bronfman. Joan revealed that following Edgar's decision to fire Ron from the company, her husband began taking drugs which led to money problems.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ac9320c00e41-ronald-kass-joan-collins.jpg><p id=elmBzp3cUbNk data-wc=48>"Together, we went to counsellors, marriage specialists and psychiatrists — to no avail," the actress revealed. "By the time Dynasty came along in 1982, saving my life and my career, ours was a marriage in name only. It was a pretence we kept up just for Katy's sake.</p><p id=erSMsVk2lSe1 data-wc=21>Although there was huge interest in me because of my role as Alexis, my personal and financial life was in ruins."&nbsp;</p><p id=e4_Mpyhdipyq data-wc=31>Joan had also discovered that her husband had been forging her signature on numerous documents to obtain money, which prompted her to ask for a divorce. Their marriage ended in 1983.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Peter Holm</h3><p id=eURlqRdJC-Sv data-wc=38>Joan has described her fourth husband – Peter Holm – as "a mixture of obdurate dullard and calculating sociopath." A former pop singer, Peter wed Joan in Las Vegas in November 1985 after meeting through a mutual friend.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/245a2092c384-joan-collins-peter-holm.jpg><p id=eb5FZAdehoGI data-wc=57>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a> in 2013, Joan explained why their marriage came to an abrupt end in 1987. "We married at the height of my Dynasty fame, but I came home early from work one day and found him in bed with another woman," she said. "Our marriage was a sham, and I was his meal ticket."</p><p id=eGdTvLGuOq3M data-wc=41>The former couple's divorce proceedings were far from smooth sailing. "At one point, Peter's long-term mistress — the one I'd caught him in bed with, ridiculously named Passion Flower — took to the stand and histrionically fainted," Joan told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Mail Online</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/082af33c91f6-joan-collins-peter-holm.jpg><p id=edTM2U_AyUWB data-wc=34>"Predictably, Peter was desperate to prove that our pre-nup was invalid so he could claim half of everything I possessed. He lost, and the judge ordered me to pay him only $80,000 in compensation."</p><h3 dir=ltr>Percy Gibson</h3><p id=eNVYYS2TaB7p data-wc=28>It was in 2000 that Joan eventually found love with Percy Gibson. At the time, Joan was acting in a play that Percy was producing in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/b6a1fb37b76c-joan-collins-percy-gibson.jpg><p id=eflZI8G12Gj7 data-wc=58>Before meeting her fifth husband, Joan was adamant that she would not remarry, but it didn't take long for the pair to fall for one another. "We hit it off immediately. He was funny, engaging, good-looking, and after the show, I would socialize with him, my co-star George Hamilton and my daughter Katy," she wrote in Mail Online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/bc83645eb545-joan-collins-husband-percy-shooting-star-event.jpg><p id=eeIAawjtjLyJ data-wc=64>Joan and Percy eventually wed on 17 February 2002 in a ceremony at Claridge's Hotel in London. "Percy is the most honorable man I've ever met," Joan <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>told PEOPLE</a> shortly after they tied the knot. "He's so much his own person and extremely secure in his own skin." They later renewed their vows at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles in March 2009.&nbsp;</p><p id=e82VcdvBxDxd data-wc=50>Opening up to<strong></strong> in 2015, Joan later explained how happy she is as Percy's wife. "It is my fifth marriage, and my happiest, and last," she said. "Percy is wonderful, he's my soul mate. That doesn't mean we don't bicker but we are very understanding of each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/366fa0385cfb-joan-collins-vow-renewal.jpg><p id=eMRps8I8t-lW data-wc=45>Despite their age gap of over 30 years, it couldn't be more inconsequential to Joan and Percy. "I was in my 60s and he was in his 30s [when we met], but the age difference never posed a problem," she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a> in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4gFfVbEGhLJ data-wc=34>"We talked it through and he didn't want children. He adores my children and grandchildren. We've been married for 11 years, but when I look at him across a room, my heart still skips."&nbsp;</p><p id=e89dUKBnfB data-wc=58><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWVb21vZ5qkrq95wqijpaGeqHqntdWeZKGto5eur7DSZqmerpWWuaawjJ%2BYpqelqHquwdKimmaZnpl6rrvVopxmq6SWv7R7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoan-collins-five-husbands-revealed-famous-music-and-movie-stars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoan-collins-five-husbands-revealed-famous-music-and-movie-stars.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoan-collins-five-husbands-revealed-famous-music-and-movie-stars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoan-collins-five-husbands-revealed-famous-music-and-movie-stars.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoan-collins-five-husbands-revealed-famous-music-and-movie-stars.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoan-collins-five-husbands-revealed-famous-music-and-movie-stars.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./julia-fox-shorts-suit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./julia-fox-shorts-suit.html>Julia Fox Girl-Bossed Her Way Through New York in a Massive Shorts Suit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-self-tanners-for-face.html>Facial Self Tanners Wont Break You Out or Leave You Looking Orange</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-self-tanners-for-face.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
