She and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> then left The Firm in 2020 after they revealed they were seeking “financial independence.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now reside in California with their two children, Archie, four, and Lilibet, two. But the origins of their romance aren’t what we believe they are.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-620135878-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-markus-anderson-s-friendship>Meghan Markle and Markus Anderson’s friendship</h2><p>Meghan Markle and Markus Anderson have been good friends for many years. Their friendship goes as far back as her first marriage to <a href=#>movie</a> producer <a href=#>Trevor Engelson</a>. The pair married in 2011 but split two years later, and Markus was there to support the 42-year-old during the difficult time.</p><p>It’s not clear how the <a href=#>celebrities</a> met, but they both lived in Toronto, Canada at some point and are rumored to have been running in the same social circles, so it’s no surprise they eventually became close. He apparently introduced her to <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star George Clooney and his wife Amal as well as stylist and friend Jessica Mulroney.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry went on a disastrous grocery shopping trip which caused him to ‘panic’</a></p><p>As he was so connected, it was suspected the global membership director at Soho House (somewhere he has built himself up after starting out as a waiter) had introduced the couple. However, it doesn’t seem to be the case.</p><p>In Harry’s 2023 memoir Spare and their engagement interview, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry named a woman rather than Markus Anderson, as the person who set them up, who is a mutual friend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-reminisces-about-seeing-meghan-for-the-first-time-on-instagram>Harry reminisces about seeing Meghan for the first time – on Instagram</h2><p>In his book, Harry cleared up how he became acquainted with Meghan Markle, and it wasn’t her friend Markus Anderson. Instead, it was their mutual friend Violet who gave the actress his details after he saw her while scrolling <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Before she had a chance to <a href=#>turn him down on a first-date suggestion</a>, Harry said he didn’t know she was an actress. He seemed to have never heard of the law <a href=#>TV</a> drama, Suits, in which she played Rachel Zane. At the time they connected on social media, she was in London doing some work for Ralph Lauren.</p><p>The <a href=#>royal</a> penned: “I sent Violet a message. ‘Who… is … this… woman?’ She answered straight away. ‘Yeah, I’ve had six other guys ask me.’ Great, I thought. ‘Who is she, Violet?’ ‘Actress. She’s in a TV show called Suits.'”</p><p>He continued by telling readers <a href=#>how he received her first message</a>, and they later continued texting late into the night.</p><p>In their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">engagement interview</a> in 2017, they referred to her as “Mrs A” as Meghan said they “should protect her privacy and not reveal too much.”</p><p>Meghan said: “Yes, it was definitely set-up, a blind date,” the mom-of-two explained.</p><p>“I didn’t know much about him, the only thing I asked her when she said she wanted to set us up was, I have one question ‘Is he nice?’” she added. “If he wasn’t kind, it wouldn’t make sense, but then it turned really quickly into that.”</p><p>However, even if Markus didn’t set Meghan and Harry up, it is known Anderson arranged private dates for the pair in London. So her good pal was involved in the blossoming of their love in some way.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Opinion: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Lilibet name debate is royals’ worst nightmare</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eDcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y56qZpqVqMFustGinKecXZm2pbrTZpicrKWWua3FjKKlraqfmcKksYyhnKtlpKR6sb7Ip5qeZZiWv7PFjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markles-best-friend-didnt-actually-introduce-her-to-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeghan-markles-best-friend-didnt-actually-introduce-her-to-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markles-best-friend-didnt-actually-introduce-her-to-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeghan-markles-best-friend-didnt-actually-introduce-her-to-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markles-best-friend-didnt-actually-introduce-her-to-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markles-best-friend-didnt-actually-introduce-her-to-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./morgan-willett-and-jay-starrett.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./morgan-willett-and-jay-starrett.html>Morgan Willett and Jay Starrett</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./520867-john-egbert-didnt-h-omestuck-character.html>John Egbert: 10 things you didn't know about the Homestuck character</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./520867-john-egbert-didnt-h-omestuck-character.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
