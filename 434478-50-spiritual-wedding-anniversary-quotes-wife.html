The Bible has beautiful verses that are perfect for a religious happy anniversary. The verses express the feelings and promises of love.</p><ul><li>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18</li><li>Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of one’s house for love, it would be utterly scorned. Songs of Songs 8:7</li><li>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Therefore, dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 1 John 4:7-12.</li><li>Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy; it does not boast; it is not proud. It does not dishonour others; it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, trusts, always hopes and always perseveres. 1 Corinthians 13:4-8.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ecc3650386730dc0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful wedding quotes about love and partnership</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3fe6d5874f166dfe.png><ul><li>Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labour: One can help the other up if either of them falls. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. So also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. Ecclesiastes 4:9-12.</li><li>He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favour from the LORD. Proverbs 18:22.</li><li>My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. John 15:12-13.</li><li>Do everything in love. 1 Corinthians 16:14</li><li>Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. Song of Songs 3:4</li><li>Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. Song of Songs 8:6</li><li>And now these three remain faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. 1 Corinthians 13:13</li><li>Be devoted to one another in love. Honour one another above yourselves. Romans 12:10</li><li>If I speak in the tongues of men or angels but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing. 1 Corinthians 13:1-3.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It takes love, respect, and commitment for two to stay together in marriage.
