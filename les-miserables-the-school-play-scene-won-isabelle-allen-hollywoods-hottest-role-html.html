The rest, as they say, is history.’</span></p><p><span>Taylor went on: ‘I have seen many young talents over the years and&nbsp; Isabelle has that something extra.&nbsp; You can call it charisma or screen presence; she’s got it.</span></p><p><span>‘She did brilliantly in the school production and when I see her face on the film posters now I feel so proud.</span></p><p><span>‘I’ve heard she’s absolutely marvellous in the film. I’m not surprised.&nbsp; She is a natural – she has a face the camera loves, sings beautifully and can also act.’</span></p><p><span>One year after Taylor spotted her,&nbsp; Isabelle now stars alongside A-list actors Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway.</span></p><p><span>Jackman describes Isabelle as the heart of the film. ‘It’s her first movie and she has no idea how good she is,’ he said. ‘She’s incredible. Totally pure and unspoilt. She is the movie.’<br></span></p><p><span>Taylor, who was awarded an OBE for services to musical theatre and young people in 2010, works extensively in schools as a visiting director. Isabelle is the latest in a long line of successful talent-spotting.</span></p><p><span>In the 37 years since he founded the NYMT he has helped shape some of Britain’s leading performers, including actor Eddie Redmayne, who plays the student revolutionary Marius in Les Mis.

He was extremely funny.’ Flamboyant pop singer Mika also started out with Taylor. ‘We first came across him in a church opera. As a little boy he had one of the most beautiful&nbsp; treble voices I’ve ever heard in my life,’ he said. ‘I saw him as a classical singer, but then he was always an unusual and mysterious chap.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps his most famous former student is Jude Law. ‘He was about 13 and so beautiful that at first some people thought he was a girl,’ Taylor said.<br></span></p><p><span>'She's incredible.

Just over a year ago she was an ordinary little girl who lived with her father Nigel, managing director of a&nbsp; computer company, mother Elaine, an interior designer, and a 14-year-old sister Amelia, in East Sussex where she enjoyed playing the piano, singing, cycling and hanging out with her friends.</span></p><p><span>YET last Wednesday the schoolgirl walked the red carpet at the glittering UK premier of Les Miserables in Leicester Square with a quiet assurance that belied her youth. ‘It’s been so exciting and so much fun, she said. ‘All the stars were so nice to me. When I first went on the set I was a bit scared, but really excited.’</span></p><p><span>She quickly discovered, however, that acting is not always glamorous.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She had to walk barefoot for hours in cold fake snow, her eyes stung from the menthol used to make her cry on cue, and once she accidentally spilled a bucket of freezing water over herself.</span></p><p><span>But if she has adapted with remarkable ease to her new status her parents remain stunned by her change of fortune. ‘We never expected her to win such a major part. It came totally out of the blue,’ says mother Elaine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘It’s still very strange seeing her face on the poster. But she has taken it all in her stride and is very grounded. She’s still the same Issy.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/08/article-2245270-165DD413000005DC-147_634x350.jpg height=350 width=634 alt="World premiere: Isabelle with the cast on Wednesday where she said: 'All the stars were so nice to me.

A clearly confused Isabelle tweeted: ‘Why would someone pretend to be me??’</span></p><p><span>Only a short time later she tweeted, more wisely: ‘I’m not really sure why&nbsp; people are making up things about me. I don’t want to get involved in it tho.’</span></p><p><span>Now, on the back of her film success, she has landed the same role in the current West End production of Les Miserables and film scripts are pouring in.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Her agent, Gaynor Shaw of Hobsons International, says Isabelle has what it takes to go far in the business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘She is clever, vivacious and very funny. She certainly should have a very bright future as an actress.’</span></p><p><span>Les Miserables is released in America on Christmas Day with its first showing in the UK on January 11.</span></p><h2><span>And our man's verdict?

Well, 60 million people in 42 different countries already have.</span></p><p><span>Tom Hooper’s stunning new film adaptation can only add to the stunning – and somewhat surprising&nbsp; – popularity of a musical that owes its origins to the 1862 novel of the same less-than-inspiring name, written by&nbsp; Victor Hugo and set in the post-revolutionary France of the&nbsp; mid-19th Century. It is a tale of disappointment, betrayal and death and yet audiences love it.</span></p><p><span>In bringing it to the screen, Hooper, who in 2011 won the Oscar for Best Director for The King’s Speech, made two bold and quite brilliant decisions. Faced with a production in which all but perhaps a dozen lines of dialogue are sung rather than spoken, he decided to use actors rather than singers and then got them to sing ... for real, in each and every take. If there has been any clever tinkering in the dubbing suite afterwards, you certainly can’t hear it.</span></p><p><span>The result is truly transformative. You go to see the stage musical because you want to hear the finest singing: you’ll go&nbsp; to see the film because the raw emotions of Hugo’s tragedy-laced story shine through as never before. Susan Boyle brought a tear to the eye when she famously belted out I Dreamed A Dream on Britain’s Got Talent but when Anne Hathaway, as poor, doomed Fantine, sings it here, in a high, fragile, faltering voice, it will break your heart. Australian actor Hugh Jackman takes on the central role of Jean Valjean and does so so wonderfully that awards are surely certain to be showered upon him.<br></span></p><p><span>Jackman is almost unrecognisable for the first 15 minutes when Valjean, a convict who has served 19 years for stealing a single loaf of bread, is finally released from prison. But, slowly, his handsome features emerge as the decades pass and, having broken the terms of his parole by taking on an assumed name, he becomes a successful businessman and&nbsp; Mayor of Montreuil.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/06/article-2244064-15AEE006000005DC-880_634x495.jpg height=495 width=634 alt="Comedic input: Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thenardier in the movie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Comedic input: Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thenardier in the movie</p><p><span>It is here that he meets the once beautiful Fantine, now working as a prostitute, taking on responsibility first for her and then in due course for her daughter, Cosette, played initially by Isabelle Allen and then later, as an adult, by Mamma Mia! actress Amanda Seyfried. But strive as Valjean might to be redeemed for his past sins, he runs the constant risk of being&nbsp; un-masked by his arch-enemy, Inspector Javert, a policeman who never forgets a face.</span></p><p><span>Russell Crowe plays Javert and does so with commendable courage. Like one or two other members of the cast, he doesn’t have the strongest singing voice but he’s in tune, and, most importantly, positively oozes the sort of malevolence that this crucial part requires.<br></span></p><p><span>Hathaway’s commitment to what is very much a supporting part is even more impressive. As one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, she sacrifices two of her crowning glories – her hair and her figure – to the role of Fantine. As the tears roll down her sunken cheeks, it is, of course, entirely right that her voice breaks with emotion. And, by the time this epic picture ends (be warned, it runs for almost 2 hours and 40 minutes) her cheeks won’t be the only damp ones, I can promise you that.</span></p><p><span>Of course, it won’t be for everyone: musical theatre-cum-light opera never is. There may even be die-hard fans of Les Mis who take exception to their favourites being sung a little less tunefully than they are used to.
