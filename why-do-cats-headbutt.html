While headbutts are seen as aggressive in the human world, cats can seem so gentle and happy when they do it. So why do cats headbutt things? We asked vets and cat behavior experts — and they say there’s not just one answer. Keep scrolling to learn more and see some adorable videos of cats headbutting their owners.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why do cats headbutt?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/KatarinaGondova.jpg><p>Cats can headbutt a variety of things — furniture, humans and even each other. They start by pressing their forehead against something, then often rub their face on the object. So why do they do it? Cat experts say there are a few top reasons:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Cats headbutt to mark their territory</h3><p>“Cats have scent glands on their forehead, cheeks and chin that allow them to deposit their scent [pheromones, or species-specific chemicals] on objects,” says <a href=#>Dr. Mikel (Maria) Delgado</a>, cat behavior expert with Rover. “Marking objects in this way sends the message, ‘I live here, and this is part of my territory.’” She notes that cats who live together and share the same “territory” will often rub on the same objects to create a singular group scent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Cat Keep Jumping on Your Counters?

It isn’t just furniture or toys (or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cardboard boxes</a>!) she may mark as her territory. If your cat has headbutted and rubbed her face on you, she may want to communicate to others that you are her human —&nbsp;nobody else’s.

Cats headbutt to show affection</h3><p>Our favorite reason your cat may headbutting you is that she loves you. “When your cat rubs its face against you, they’re not just marking territory but also expressing love and trust,” says Dr. Kong. “It’s their way of bonding with you and making you a part of their scent family.”</p><p>Those little cat headbutts are like hugs. “Headbutting is a positive sign that your cat considers you part of its family,” adds Dr. Caos. “If your cat actively seeks out physical contact with you, it’s a strong indication that they enjoy your company and feel loved.”</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Try This Slow Blink Trick to Bond Even More With Your Cat — Vets Share the Easy How-To</a></p><p>As if it couldn’t be any cuter — cats headbutt each other for the same reason. “Did you know that when cats rub their faces against each other, it’s called ‘allorubbing’?” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sabrina Kong</a>, DVM and veterinary contributor at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Love Doodles</a>. “It’s a social behavior that strengthens the bond between cats in the same group.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Cats headbutt to feel secure</h3><p>Cats have an incredibly strong sense of smell. Humans have about 5 million scent receptors — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cats have up to 200 million</a>. That means they’re not only better than us at picking up scents, they’re also better at distinguishing between them. Cats use this skill to detect potential intruders or danger. When they’re in an environment with a familiar, safe scent, they know they can relax. “Cats rub their face on things as a way for them to feel more secure in their environment,” says Dr. Kong. “It helps them surround themselves with familiar scents.”</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Why Does My Cat Sniff My Face?

Cats headbutt to get attention</h3><p>Cats are smart: They know how to manipulate us into giving them what they want. It’s pretty hard to ignore an adorable kitty bumping her head up against you, and she knows it. When she’s headbutted you in the past, you’ve probably given her some attention in the form of pets, scratches or even baby talk. Your cat may be headbutting on you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because she’s craving interaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Why Does My Cat Lick My Hair?

Do they understand it the same way when they’re on the receiving end? They very well might! Cats may see your headbutt as a show of love. Try offering your forehead to your cat and see how she responds. Don’t force it on her&nbsp; — let her headbutt you back only if she feels like it. And remember to be gentle! Kitty heads are so much smaller than ours.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cat ‘Airplane Ears’: Vets Reveal the 4 Reasons Cats Flatten Their Ears</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When cat headbutts are a problem</h2><p>It’s typically not a problem when cats headbutt objects, but you should always pay close attention to your cat’s body and behaviors. “If you notice any redness or itchy spots on your cat’s face, they may be rubbing due to discomfort or pain, not to mark their territory,” says Dr. Delgado. “If you notice any irritated areas on your cat’s face or body, you should call your veterinarian right away.”</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Do Cats Drool? Vet Explains the Reason + When You Should Be Concerned</a></p><p>Pay attention, too, to the frequency with which she headbutts things. If the behavior drastically increases, you may want to get your cat checked out. “Excessive rubbing can sometimes be a sign of underlying health issues, stress or anxiety,” says Dr. Caos. “If your cat’s behavior becomes obsessive, leads to hair loss or skin irritation or is accompanied by other concerning symptoms, it’s recommended to consult with a veterinarian to rule out any potential medical causes.”</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Does Your Cat Stare at You?
