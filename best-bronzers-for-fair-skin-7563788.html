While embracing our natural beauty comes with personal growth, pale skin is still a sticking point for many people. Pale features can lack depth and dimension, and who of the pale-persuasion hasn't been described as sickly on more than one occasion. Plus, that aura that surrounds you after a vacation and a sun-kissed — faux — tan is undeniable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I want to look (and feel) like I just got back from vacation — everyday, no matter the season. While it’s true that many makeup products are extolled as The Most Important, it’s the gorgeous glow of a good bronzer that will give your fair complexion new life. Simply put, bronzers are a lifesaver — a reliable, speedy trick to elevate my sallow complexion into a refreshed, healthy, and wide awake person, as if an Instagram-level golden hour filter has washed all over me and my porcelain skin. Plus, the rich pigment also manages to hide my old acne scars and the lingering rosacea on my cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To keep a fair complexion looking radiant — and realistic — the best bronzer needs to blend effortlessly, feel delightfully invisible on skin, and flatter your skin tone exactly. A tall order? Not with our picks below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-saie-sun-melt-bronzer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saie Sun Melt Bronzer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Saie Sun Melt Bronzer in Fair Bronze" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UcSvb4dQ5EsSECFp6eoCo1CGNwg=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Saie-Sun-Melt-Bronzer-in-Fair-Bronze-09fea6a03b354b41a301fd5900298005.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>From the creamy, skincare-infused formula to the effortless application, we absolutely adored this bronzer</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The lid is extremely secure, to the point that opening this bronzer can be a real struggle.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Through every swipe, swatch, and blend, no product created an effortless, natural sculpt quite like the Saie Sun Melt Bronzer. Extremely creamy and blendable, this buttery bronzer in fair bronze goes on sheer for a healthy-looking, soft finish that you can easily build up to completely customize your glow.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is one of my all-time favorite bronzer formulas for fair skin,” says celebrity makeup artist, Ashley Rebecca. “The cream texture adheres beautifully to skin and the color looks natural.

For expert-level application, we like to warm up the product with our fingers to make it extra melty, but if you’re a brush loyalist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Big Buffing Bronzer Brush</a> is a hero for a totally seamless, non-streaky radiance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream | <strong>Finish: </strong>Natural<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Organic colloidal oatmeal, grapeseed oil | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-undone-beauty-water-bronzer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Undone Beauty Water Bronzer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Undone Beauty Water Bronzer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lsKHA6FKYosHfDHEzwqbx693NlM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/UndoneBeautyWaterBronzerinBaked-80e1b860eb1f42faa6b3822fe8cb4743.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>On top of providing the most natural glow, this bronzer feels cooling as it's swiped across skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The coverage is very light, so it’s not great to use for ultra-glam looks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first glance, it may seem odd that this deep-toned chubby stick made a list of bronzers for fair skin, but don’t let the darker hue deter you — a single swipe reveals a subtle tan color that seamlessly melts into the fairest complexions. The Water Bronzer is unlike any bronzing formula I’ve tried: Water-based and infused with coconut water for an enhanced glow, this lightweight stick feels cool to the touch and takes minimal effort to blend. I find that using my fingers to gently tap it onto the high points of my face provides the most natural results.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we reach for this mini stick year round, it’s the only thing we use during the summer months as it feels soothing after days in the sun and is perfect for no makeup makeup looks. The intensity can be built up, but we wouldn’t recommend using this for very glam looks, as it looks best on clean, foundation-less skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Water-based stick | <strong>Finish: </strong>Natural<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Coconut water | <strong>Size: </strong>0.19 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-hourglass-cosmetics-ambient-lighting-bronzer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Powder</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hourglass Cosmetics Ambient Lighting Bronzer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hourglass Cosmetics Ambient Lighting Bronzer in Nude Bronze Light" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mBiI_urUrR41grKpuAH6LEIKiLk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HourglassCosmeticsAmbientLightingBronzerinNudeBronzeLight-d456859783064c26bae061317a3146f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The illuminating bronzer provides a multi-dimensional finish that adds depth to your face and enhances your overall look.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This is best reserved for the fairest of skin — if you lean more towards fair-medium, you may need to layer for a wow-worthy effect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ever wonder what celebrities use to achieve their ethereal, bronzed glow? More often than not, Hourglass Cosmetics Ambient Lighting Bronzer is the answer. “This is what I call my red carpet bronzer, the formula never disappoints,” says Los Angeles-based celebrity makeup artist Aaron Berry. Part bronzer, part highlighter, Hourglass combined its award-winning <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ambient Lighting Finishing Powder</a> with light bronze pigments to create this multi-dimensional formula.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it can be applied anywhere you would use a traditional bronzer, Berry especially&nbsp; recommends sweeping it across cheekbones and over the bridge of the nose to add depth to your face and create a lit-from-within glow. Former Commerce Editor, Mary Honkus, tested the shade Nude Bronze Light (Berry’s go-to for fair skin) and adored how it diffuses across her complexion. “As I buff it in, my skin looks airbrushed and my features beautifully defined. I will say, though, that the end result is more subdued than anticipated. I build it up for special occasions, but overall this pick is ideal for the fairest of skin.” If you tan easily or are more fair-medium, this will be too light for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Powder | <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Photoluminescent particles | <strong>Size: </strong>0.39 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cream-chanel-les-beige-healthy-glow-bronzing-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cream</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Glow Bronzing Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream in Soleil Tan Bronze" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f4mOvYpb4ktmAazLw3vb7WHpgRc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Chanel-Les-Beiges-Healthy-Glow-Bronzing-Cream-in-Soleil-Tan-Bronze-c97de323dbab491bb2f3bbbeb7ba34c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chanel</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This compact contains one full ounce of bronzer (the largest amount on our list) making the high price tag so much more worth it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Though labeled as non-comedogenic, the formula contains coconut oil which can be pore clogging.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Luxury beauty products tend to be hit or miss, but when it comes to Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream, you’d be hard pressed to find someone who isn’t captivated by this bronzer. Honkus tried this formula after hearing rave reviews from multiple beauty editors on the InStyle team, and she audibly said ‘wow’ after the first application (something that she had never done in her five-plus years in the beauty industry).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The beauty of this bronzer is in its simplicity: All it takes is a small sweep of the gel-cream formula to warm up fair complexions. “In seconds, I look like I stepped off a yacht in the sunny French Riviera — I have a gorgeous glow that lasts for hours and doesn’t oxidize throughout the day (no need to worry about patchiness or orange streaks here),” Honkus says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The large compact also deserves boundless praise, especially considering the price. While $50 may seem like an exorbitant amount for a bronzing product, it contains more than double the amount of other comparable options, so this will last for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream | <strong>Finish: </strong>Velvet matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>3<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Coconut oil, Kalanchoe pinnata leaf extract | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-a-healthy-glow-make-beauty-skin-mimetic-microsuede-powder-bronzer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for a Healthy Glow</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Make Beauty Skin Mimetic Microsuede Powder Bronzer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Make Beauty Skin Mimetic Microsuede Powder Bronzer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Yvjto-ipc10mmz76YVsY_y2lBtM=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Make-Beauty-Skin-Mimetic-Microsuede-Bronzer-in-Lunar-19cf3ee21ab1476b8d9b593460610f9a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The buildable powder can be used to create a variety of looks — from a subtle sun-kissed glow to a defined supermodel sculpt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The matte finish inherently looks more harsh than bronzers with radiant or natural finishes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Powder bronzers can get a bad rep — they don’t melt into skin like their cream and liquid counterparts, and it’s easy for them to become patchy as the day progresses. Make Beauty took all of those concerns into account when they created the Skin Mimetic Microsuede Bronzer, and the finished product produces even, streak-free results that Rebecca relies on regularly. “This is an excellent matte formula, it glides on the skin without looking ruddy,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We fully agree; beauty editors often favor cream formulas over powder as the latter can leave harsh, oftentimes orange lines. This smooth, neutral-yet-warm-toned formula made us believe in powder bronzers again because of the way it smoothed onto our skin. While it applies like a traditional powder, the end result is comparable to a cream. I attribute this to the hydrating ingredients, including squalane and hyaluronic acid, that leave my complexion looking velvety and warm. As a bonus, the lightweight bronzer is extremely buildable, making it easy to craft subtle glows and dramatic sculpts alike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Powder | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Squalane, ceramides | <strong>Size: </strong>0.26 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-cool-undertones-benefit-cosmetics-hoola-matte-bronzer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Cool Undertones</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Benefit Cosmetics Hoola Matte Bronzer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Benefit Cosmetics Hoola Matte Bronzer in Hoola Light" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Mpf-NHs5T_NMAz3YoIAPFGpGFmw=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Benefit-Hoola-Matte-Bronzer-in-Hoola-Light-0a5cc4f6794a4b9db354c2d47f483956.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Benefit Cosmetics</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This Hoola Light shade is ideal for bronzer beginners, plus, it’s multi-purpose — try using it as a definition-enhancing finishing powder.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This specific hue may wash out those with warm undertones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Benefit’s iconic Hoola Bronzer burst onto the beauty scene in 2001, and it’s been a favorite of makeup artists and fair-skinned shoppers ever since. Though the original shade (Hoola) works for light skin tones, Berry prefers Hoola Light. “This is a great first step into bronzer,” he says. “It has a very neutral undertone — not too yellow or orange. It’s also a great finishing powder to dust over your usual makeup routine.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I wish this soft hue was around when I first started using bronzer years ago: Even though the formula is matte, it’s impossible to create harsh orange lines, no matter how much product I apply,” Honkus says. “Although it looks relatively light in the pan, it still adds a touch of color to my face and defines my features in an understated way, making it great for everyday use. That said, I reserve this for the winter months when my skin is nearly translucent — it’d be a touch too light when I have a tan, and overall, will wash out those with warm undertones.” If you have neutral or cool undertones like I do, this is a foolproof pick.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Powder | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Silicone-based polymers | <strong>Size: </strong>0.21 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-kosas-the-sun-show-glowy-warmth-baked-bronzer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kosas The Sun Show Glowy Warmth Baked Bronzer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Kosas The Sun Show Glowy Warmth Baked Bronzer in Waves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/24kn3Nt52lvhjiKFW2tzA2RobK4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kosas-The-Sun-Show-Glowy-Warmth-Baked-Bronzer-in-Waves-e39314c9ac7a4e9884700217f06faacb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Forget golden hour, this luminous bronzer gives skin a comparable glow that lasts all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you apply too much it can be difficult to blend out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t have to wait for golden hour (or go on vacation) to get an impeccable, photo-ready glow. In fact, just a quick dusting of The Sun Show Baked Bronzer from Kosas will do the trick. A cross between a bronzer and a highlighter, this shimmery baked powder knocks out two steps in one swipe, adding a dewy warmth and subtle sheen to my complexion.

A powder is the only way for me to get the look I want.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet after MAC discontinued Clark’s beloved powder bronzer, she thought all hope was lost for her collarbone — until they replaced it with this one, which she says she likes even better. “Radiant Medium Golden looks phenomenal on my skin, and the radiant finish has the magical effect of a soft, sunset glow,” she says. “I also appreciate that it’s dermatologist-tested because my temperamental skin needs no excuse to break out.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Specs of shimmer not your thing?

In this case, the answer is by using a surplus of natural, plant-based ingredients like mango, cupuaçu, and cocoa butters.&nbsp;This trio conditions the skin and allows the bronzer glides across complexions without skipping, leaving an illuminating brilliance in its wake, and making it an especially great pick for anyone with mature skin who wants to combat dullness. Plus, the brand thoughtfully left out potentially irritating ingredients such as mineral oil and parabens so that sensitive skin can reap these dazzling benefits as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And, trust us, no one will want to be left out of the conversation here since both shades, Terra and Gold Dust, look like they were touched by Midas himself as they boast just a hint of shimmer, imparting a sophisticated amount of color onto the skin.

Additionally, the light and light medium hues won’t pull orange, adding to our natural lit-from-within look, and they dry down matte which is a boon for anyone with oily skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only pain point is how the bronzer seems to occasionally get stuck when twisting it out of the tube, so hopefully, the brand will consider redesigning the packaging soon.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Coconut oil and glycerin derivatives | <strong>Size: </strong>0.37 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We began our search for the best bronzers for fair skin by tapping InStyle editors to ask for their tried and true formulas.

Cooler undertones are also usually a safe bet for fair skin, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Westman Atelier’s Face Trace stick</a>, as they’re mostly devoid of orange pigments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many people tend to make a big fuss about skin undertones, and yes, it’s a good thing to know, but Rebecca has a far more approachable (and realistic) method of shade matching. “If you have fair skin, I will advise applying three tones of bronzer that you're drawn to on the inside of your arm. Compare the shades and see which one looks the most natural on your skin and is the most believable,” she says. “When you compare three different shades, it's easy to spot which one is too orange.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula + Finish</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I think some of the biggest struggles are knowing and deciding what formula will work best for you,” says Berry, who took the words right out of our mouth. Ultimately, the right formula comes down to personal preference, and any skin concerns you’re trying to mask, like fine lines, dry patches, or uneven skin tone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I think cream formulas are very forgiving and work great on most skin types,” he says, adding that it’s also easy to wipe off with a makeup wipe if you’ve been a tad heavy handed (another no no for fair skin types). A blend with a foundation brush with no additional product can also help melt in harsh lines.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, if your skin leans oily, the dewy finish of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream bronzer</a> may exacerbate the issue, and a powder option may be a better fit. If fine lines on your face and neck are a familiar foe, steer way clear of shimmer or glitter, says Vargas, because it will just call more attention to the area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Liquid formulations are typically richly pigmented and come in both matte and radiant finishes, but they’re also a devil to get just right. “If you don't know where to begin, a brush helps immensely with this and you'll get into the rhythm,” reassures Rebecca.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Blendability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The entire allure of bronzer is that it’s easy, effortless, and undoubtedly flattering, but if you have a formula that won’t budge, it will do just the opposite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A great bronzer should be easily blendable, so you can buff it across your face for a naturally glamorous look,” says Vargas. “If it’s not blending, it just sits on top of the skin and looks unnatural and muddy — literally, it looks like red mud on your face.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Exactly no one wants this outcome, so no matter the formula or shade you choose, “it should blend seamlessly,” says Berry.
