They met in 1977 when she was working as a waitress at a Beverly Hills nightclub called The Daisy and he was still married to his first wife, Marguerite, but their marriage was on the rocks. Simpson and Brown began dating, and Simpson eventually divorced Whitley in 1979. He and Brown then married in 1985.</p><p>But their relationship would be tainted by volatility. “It was a very passionate, a very volatile, a very obsessive relationship. On both sides,”&nbsp;Cathy Lee Crosby, who knew O.J. for 15 years and had spent time with the couple, told the&nbsp;LA&nbsp;Times.</p><p>“I fell in love with Nicole Brown immediately,”&nbsp;Kris&nbsp;Jenner, who met Nicole in 1978,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>wrote in her 2011 memoir&nbsp;Kris Jenner…and All Things Kardashian. “We were destined to become best friends. … [She] had really fallen for O.J.,” she continued. “The two of them were madly in love and had this obvious chemistry that you could feel when you were in the same room with them…they absolutely could not keep their hands off each other. He was already incredibly possessive of Nicole. Even when she would go to the bathroom, O.J. would wonder out loud when she was going to come back.”</p><p>Their daughter&nbsp;Sydney&nbsp;was born that October and son&nbsp;Justin&nbsp;arrived in August 1988. Nicole didn’t speak openly about her relationship with OJ to anyone, really. During an appearance with Ellen Degeneres, Kris revealed that she had plans to have lunch with Nicole the day after she died.</p><p>“I didn’t know that there was abuse until we heard and saw the whole thing unfold like everybody else and then heard the 911 tapes that were going to be used in evidence during the trial,” she said. “It was heartbreaking… Me and some of her other close friends were all really surprised and shocked by that, because we felt we really failed her as a friend. It was horrible.”&nbsp;</p><p>They divorced in 1992. Two years later, Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman were found brutally killed outside of Nicole’s home. Simpson quickly became the prime suspect in the case, which sparked a media frenzy. The subsequent trial, known as the People v. O.J. Simpson, lasted for nearly nine months from 1994 to 1995.</p><p>It was one of the most widely publicized trials in American history, broadcast live on television and closely followed by the public. His defense team, <a href=#>led by prominent attorneys like Robert Kardashian</a> and Johnnie Cochran, successfully argued that Simpson was framed and that evidence was mishandled by the police.</p><p>Despite substantial evidence against him, including DNA evidence and circumstantial evidence, Simpson was acquitted of all criminal charges on October 3, 1995. The verdict was met with widespread controversy and debate, with many believing that Simpson had gotten away with murder.</p><p>In a subsequent civil trial in 1997, Simpson was found liable for the wrongful deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and was ordered to pay millions in damages to their families. However, he has maintained his innocence in the murders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfpLduv8imp6ynnmLEqrLEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foj-simpson-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2foj-simpson-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2foj-simpson-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2foj-simpson-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foj-simpson-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2foj-simpson-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./victoriabeckham.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./victoriabeckham.html>Posh takes home style gong in Madrid</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./diana-vreeland-quotes-summer.html>Diana Vreeland's Best Fashion Quotes To Live By</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./diana-vreeland-quotes-summer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
