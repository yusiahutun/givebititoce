Five years later, ITV has revived the popular reality competition show. So how can you catch up to all the drama and competition?

AJ Odudu and Will Best&nbsp;are hosting Big Brother UK. Big Brother will be followed each night by Big Brother: Late & Live, hosted live by AJ and WIll from the site of the Big Brother house in front of a studio audience, where evictees will be interviewed. AJ previously Big Brother’s Bit on the Side in 2013.</p><p>Will and AJ revealed that during the audition process, they cried. “We had to do so much in the audition. We did a ‘hello’ and a welcome. We had to basically act as though we were presenting the shows; we had to do an eviction interview, we had to watch clips, it was quite a lot actually,” AJ shared with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/05/big-brothers-aj-odudu-burst-into-tears-and-though-she-blew-audition-19603233/?ito=newsnow-feed" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro.</a></p><p>“We were so moved by the whole thing we both cried and then, bless Will, I just remember Will messaging me after going: ‘I think I really messed up that audition. Why was I crying?'” AJ recalled.</p><p>“And I was like: ‘Mate, me too. Why we were crying in an audition? Like we’re trying to get a job and we’re both sobbing! This is awful.’ We’d absolutely dropped the ball.”</p><p>In a host profile the hosts revealed what they think would be the biggest obstacles for the Big Brother contestants.&nbsp;“I think the biggest challenge is that the Big Brother house is 24/7,” AJ recalled. “You share the same bedroom, the same spaces, the same food, everything! I grew up with five brothers and two sisters and all ten of us (including my parents) lived in a small space under the same roof. I love my family to bits, but I’ve done my time, I’m riding solo now.”</p><p>As for Will, he can’t go without one thing he uses every day. “Probably being without their phones! Most people (myself very much included) can’t go 30 seconds without checking it, so that first week is going to be tough. Then there’s the fact they’ll be in there with people who, in the outside world, they’d probably never meet, let alone live with. That’s going to test them in all sorts of ways. And no, I don’t think I’d last long in the house. I‘ve got a sneaking suspicion I’m riddled with annoying habits.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
