<time>29 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>After Kate Middleton’s 42nd birthday earlier this week, her astrology chart for 2024 shows the princess needs a “break” as she feels like she’s “always missing out on something.”</strong></p><p>An astrologer has claimed <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> is apparently “spreading herself too thin” as we enter the new year. The stars are showing the future queen needs a “rest.” This isn’t a surprise considering the past few years she and the rest of the <a href=#>royal</a> family have had. Thankfully, she seems to have enjoyed her latest <a href=#>birthday after a few upsetting years</a>. This includes the departure of <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and his wife as senior royals which was announced on her 38th birthday.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1353280203-1024x758.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-s-astrology-chart-advises-her-to-take-it-easy>Kate Middleton’s astrology chart advises her to take it easy</h2><p>Speaking to Slingo, astrologer Inbaal Honigman <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> Kate Middleton’s 2024 chart suggests she is “focused on too many commitments” at the moment. The Princess of Wales is a Capricorn, and Honigman says this means she is “focused and determined’ and “gets stuff done”. However, this leaves Kate feeling as though she is “always missing out on something.”</p><p>Calling Kate “no-nonsense Capricorn,” Honigman explained: “It’s no accident that Catherine can carry out all her duties, manage a busy household, and support the heir to the throne, all the while looking like she’s stepped out of a salon.</p><p>“It’s all in a day’s work for a capable Capricorn.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>9 of Kate Middleton’s most iconic moments – Bond Girl to Louis’ tantrum on camera</a></p><p>The tarot card reader said the emotional 5 of Cups explains Catherine wishes she had more time for herself and her hobbies, including photography.</p><p>“The tireless future Queen appears to be stretched quite thinly and is focused on too many commitments as she steps forward into 2024,” she claimed. “She’d love to be able to make more time for fun family days, she’d love to attend more photography galleries and fashion shows”</p><p>Another card appearing during the reading was the 10 of Wands, which supports the 5 of Cups one. It shows her wanting to be “all things to all people,” according to Honigman – something typical of the Capricorn sign.</p><p>“The Princess of Wales could use a break or a holiday,” she continued. “The key to her ambition in wanting to be all things to all people rests in her sign of Capricorn, which is an ambitious and focused star sign that doesn’t rest until all the work is done.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-s-family-reading>Kate’s family reading</h2><p>Like <a href=#>Prince William</a>, the 42-year-old’s moon sign is a Cancer. She is an “affectionate” parent and a “caring wife”, according to the stars. This is, again, something typical of a Cancer sign.</p><p>Honigman said: “Behind closed doors, she would be a loving and affectionate parent and a supportive and caring wife. Cancer is a sign that’s all about the family, so Catherine will have likely been an unselfish daughter and sister.”</p><p>Kate Middleton’s astrology reading for 2024 also makes a prediction about her future on the throne.</p><p>“Her sun and moon signs together suggest that she would be a sensible and sympathetic Queen,” it reads.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-s-astrology-chart-reveals-he-s-in-planning-mode>Prince William’s astrology chart reveals he’s in ‘planning mode’</h2><p>Just like his wife, <a href=#>Prince William’s stars have also been predicted for this year</a>. 2024 will be “game-changing” for the Prince of Wales, apparently. The first few months will see him being in “planning mode” when it comes to “his responsibilities and commitments.”</p><p>Between March 25 and April 25, it will be a full moon for both Kate Middleton and her husband, according to their 2024 astrology charts. Astrologer Debbie Frank explained it would be a “team effort” for the two of them during this time. In May, he will have a “feel-good factor” about his personal and public life. Meanwhile, June 21, his birthday, will see him “break tradition.”</p><p>As for the rest of William’s 2024, Frank explained: “The great mover and shaker planet Uranus encourages breaking with tradition and creating new initiatives. We can expect William will ‘make a difference’ and do things his way during this time.</p><p>She continued: “Autumn is another big pulse point for the Prince. The eclipsed New Moon on his Mars in statesman-like Libra expands his reach in the world. October is going to be a power month for the Prince and Princess of Wales. The autumn and winter ready William for 2025 which continues to raise his star.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>9 subtle ways Kate Middleton has won over royal fans without much effort</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2FcMDIq5ylnaOoeqyt055kpqGUmbmmwM6nZJ%2BdlaHAbrjIpJxmq5iawG65yKyqoqaXYry2wIyopWarn6KytbTIp55mmaOpv7C4zqCcq2Wjlsa0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftireless-kate-middleton-feels-like-shes-missing-out-on-something-astrologer-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftireless-kate-middleton-feels-like-shes-missing-out-on-something-astrologer-says.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftireless-kate-middleton-feels-like-shes-missing-out-on-something-astrologer-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftireless-kate-middleton-feels-like-shes-missing-out-on-something-astrologer-says.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftireless-kate-middleton-feels-like-shes-missing-out-on-something-astrologer-says.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftireless-kate-middleton-feels-like-shes-missing-out-on-something-astrologer-says.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aaron-carter-says-hes-expecting-child-with-girlfriend-melanie-martin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aaron-carter-says-hes-expecting-child-with-girlfriend-melanie-martin.html>Aaron Carter Expecting First Child with Girlfriend Melanie Martin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./split-your-desktop-into-two-using-desktopcoral-windows.html>Split Your Desktop Into Two Using DesktopCoral [Windows]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./split-your-desktop-into-two-using-desktopcoral-windows.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
