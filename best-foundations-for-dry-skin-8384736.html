"Powders can settle into dry skin and flaky patches and accentuate fine lines, too." And if you're unsure if you should look for a matte, dewy or serum-like formula, makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Grace Lee</a> recommends "medium coverage foundations with a natural or dewy finish, because they usually have more moisturizing and nourishing ingredients in them."

Plus, it has a gel/liquid-like texture that makes applying with your go-to dense brush or beauty sponge (you can use your fingers, too!) an easy process.&nbsp;We also love how extensive the shade range is, and there’s even a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">shade finder quiz</a> available on Glossier’s website if you’re struggling to find the right one for your shade/undertone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Squalane, glycerin, plankton extract | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Coverage: </strong>Light/medium | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 32 | <strong>SPF:</strong> No | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-neutrogena-healthy-skin-liquid-makeup-spf-20></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Healthy Skin Liquid Makeup SPF 20</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Healthy Skin Liquid Makeup SPF 20" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BdqHj23Y2E4rGjYc3dbnrD_tr6w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/neutrogena-healthy-skin-liquid-makeup-spf-20-7d5a54d9ac954a098f54bf4b409e6e89.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The natural finish and feel, plus the inclusion of SPF, makes this product a great daytime foundation option.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The shade range is lacking for darker skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a proud member of the dry and sensitive skin club (like our writer is), you’ve likely picked up a Neutrogena product from the drugstore at least once during your adolescent years, and maybe even well into adulthood. Recommended by many dermatologists (Barber's included), this foundation feels lightweight and gives skin a natural-looking, even finish. With glycerin, vitamin E, and feverfew extracts, the formula is packed with moisturizing bonafides. Even better? You'll get a bit of protection with SPF 20, making it a great choice for everyday wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing we should note is that although this product feels more accessible to those close to a drugstore or with a more limited makeup budget, the shade range skews towards light to medium skin tones, so we cannot justify its accessibility in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Glycerin, feverfew extract, vitamin E | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Coverage: </strong>Medium | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 14 | <strong>SPF:</strong> 20 | <strong>Size: </strong>1 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-mature-skin-jones-road-beauty-what-the-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry, Mature Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty What the Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty What the Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2638WMrlty15BKIqVQfOcYN_Bwc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-what-the-foundation-b27d8a60043342b4a201570b648512bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This foundation acts more as a tinted, moisturizing balm, giving it the perfect, your-skin-but-better finish and feel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The formula can have a strange consistency when you first open the product, so you’ll have to mix it prior to applying it to your skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We understand that at first glance, this foundation from Jones Road doesn’t look like your traditional foundation formula, and that can be a little off-putting. We’re here to tell you that this unconventional appearance is the secret ingredient to the perfect foundation for not only dry skin but dry, mature skin. Jojoba oil is the star ingredient in this "tinted moisture balm," alongside hyaluronic acid to help glide over dry patches and blend with ease.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although a balm texture may sound strange, it looks and feels like you're not wearing a thing, and you'll never have to worry about whether you look cakey. Plus, the light to medium coverage level (it’s buildable) provides a natural finish, rather than one that looks too heavy on aging skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Jojoba oil, sodium hyaluronate | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Coverage: </strong>Light/medium | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 12 | <strong>SPF:</strong> No | <strong>Size: </strong>1.14<strong> </strong>oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-full-coverage-smashbox-always-on-skin-balancing-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Full-Coverage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Smashbox Always On Skin Balancing Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Smashbox Always On Skin Balancing Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3x-orX_8Vd-vZCpi4Vvd7sKN0IM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2023-07-13T151904.033-c3b6c6b4419543fa88767b1f08616807.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Smashbox</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This foundation offers full-coverage without looking (or feeling) cakey on the skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The price point is a little high, but we think you get your money’s worth, thanks to the full-coverage and flawless finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Every year without fail, my skin dries out like a desert cactus in the summer heat and despite this fact, I’m still supremely lazy when it comes to applying moisturizer, which is why I’m obsessed with this hyaluronic-acid-infused foundation from Smashbox,” says InStyle Commerce Writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a>. “The ultra hydrating ingredient helps me skip a few steps in my skincare routine and keeps my makeup from clinging to flaky dry patches." Due to the liquid formulation, you also have a ton of freedom when it comes to the application method, but Richardson prefers to use a firm complexion brush to buff it out, specifically <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Danessa Myricks Yummy Face 1.0 All Over Complexion Brush</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the Always On Skin-Balancing Foundation feels like nothing more than your favorite hydrating moisturizer, it actually offers more coverage than the other options on this list. So, if you prefer a full beat (but still like your coverage to look natural) for your everyday makeup routine, this is definitely a product to consider.&nbsp;Alongside its hydrating benefits, this formula also includes adaptogens, specifically licorice root and sea asparagus, which help to keep your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin barrier</a> in check.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Hyaluronic acid, licorice root, sea asparagus | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Coverage: </strong>Full | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 30 | <strong>SPF:</strong> No | <strong>Size: </strong>1<strong> </strong>oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-bareminerals-original-loose-powder-foundation-spf-15></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Powder</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BareMinerals Original Loose Powder Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BareMinerals Original Loose Powder Foundation SPF 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GI6rpb2aZ3wCg4AozyC9do5jMgA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bareminerals-original-loose-powder-foundation-spf-15-78dce592728d43e180f8694be7c5aaa2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macys</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Although dry skin types are typically recommended to steer clear of powder formulas, this option works just as well as other liquid or cream options.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the SPF level in this formula was at least SPF 30.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve had problematic skin my whole life, from acne to dryness to rosacea, and I’ve tried nearly every foundation under the sun over the years, but I keep coming back to this BareMinerals foundation," says InStyle senior beauty commerce editor, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaitlin Clark</a>. "I’ve been using it since high school and I honestly haven’t found a better foundation that works with my sensitive skin and still gives me the full-coverage I want.

Maybelline’s Fit Me Dewy + Smooth Foundation is perfect for anyone seeking a drugstore option that provides the same radiant finish as higher-end options on the market.

This beloved foundation has a barely-there feel on your skin, thanks to the totally sheer, liquid formula that you can keep sheer or use to build coverage as you please.

This foundation is not just any liquid foundation, rather it functions more like a true serum, so you can easily (and evenly) blend and build it on your skin post-application, whether you prefer to use your fingers (like you would with a real serum), a brush, or a sponge.

As a medium-coverage foundation, it's not completely coating skin in an intense wash — just use a dot or two around your face and you'll have a nice, even base with a natural-looking finish. Thanks to hyaluronic acid in this formula, you can rest assured that despite how much you build up your coverage, there’s no risk of drying out your skin or clinging to dry spots as you dab your makeup sponge. Plus, Charlotte Tilbury’s trademarked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bix-Activ</a> ingredient works to limit unwanted sheen and the appearance of pores on the face.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hayley Prokos, fashion commerce editor at InStyle, favors this foundation for her combination skin.

The Softlight Skin-Smoothing Liquid Foundation truly feels like a second skin, and it’s all thanks to its soft matte finish which prevents it from looking too cakey or flat on the skin.

Take it from makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Ian Russell</a>: “Makeup is only ever as good as your skin prep.”<br>A good moisturizer is always a necessity when it comes to your pre-makeup skin prep, and it’s key to apply said moisturizer both the night before and in the AM right before application. Scibelli notes that "locking in a great nighttime moisturizer allows you to wake up with supple skin,” resulting in a far easier application process in the morning.<br></li><li><strong>Formula: </strong>"As a general rule, liquid foundations tend to be the better choice for a dry skin, especially as skincare components are now available in so many products," says Russell. Scibelli agrees, saying that he usually goes for cream or liquid foundation formulas for dry skin because "they bind to the skin easier and more smoothly, whereas powders can settle into dry skin and accentuate fine lines.”<br></li><li><strong>Finish: </strong>"A matte foundation typically contains a lot of silicones which seal the pores and decrease oil production," says Scibelli. "A dewy finish will give you that three dimensional glow, often with light reflective properties, and a natural finish is neither too dewy nor too matte — it should just look like your skin — and finally, a satin finish is a combo of both a matte and a natural finish, giving the skin a slight velvety, airbrushed effect.”<br></li><li><strong>Coverage: </strong>“Coverage refers to the opacity of makeup,” explains Russell. “Full-coverage is designed to completely cover the skin, appears opaque when applied and contains the most pigment. Sheer coverage is lightweight and the most transparent, and medium/buildable formulas are somewhere in between.”&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>“Hyaluronic acid is always a great one to look for because it draws moisture from the air and locks it into the skin for instant hydration," says Scibelli. Russell adds that he loves formulas with supporting ingredients, like squalane and nourishing plant-based oils. His favorite foundations tend to be formulated with shea butter, alongisde coconut, buriti and jojoba oils.<br></li><li><strong>Application Method: </strong>Lee suggests using a damp sponge or even just your hands for most liquid and cream formulas. "Applying foundation with your hands allows you to warm up the foundation with your hands so it goes on seamlessly," she says. "Start with thin layers and build up coverage slowly and only where needed; it's far easier to add more than to blend on dry skin."</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are serum foundations good for dry skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Serum foundation products are some of the most beneficial on the market when dealing with dry skin types," says Russell. “They feel lightweight, are packed with hydration and also include heavy-duty ingredients that target specific concerns such as aging, pigmentation and skin dullness."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you make your foundation look flawless with dry skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Skin prep is key.
