Having established herself as one of the most versatile and magnetic actors working in Hollywood today, Lily has an incredibly bright future ahead and we can't wait to see what she does next.&nbsp;</p><p id=ergQnncUTJ1 data-wc=43>Here, <strong></strong> explores Lily's awe-inspiring life and career thus far. From her early childhood on a Blackfeet reservation in Montana to the day she almost quit acting and life after finding fame in Martin Scorsese's historical drama, here's what you need to know. &nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Early life&nbsp;</h2><p id=ednHEt_tfu_ data-wc=76>Born in Kalispell, Montana on August 2, 1986, Lily grew up on a Blackfeet Reservation in Browning, before relocating to the Seattle suburbs at the age of 11. "It was very rural. It bordered Glacier National Park, which ancestrally is Blackfeet land, but until the 1970s, we couldn't access it without paying a fee," she recalled to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Telegraph</a>. "We were snowed in nine months of the year, so people watched a lot of movies."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/196e25775941-lily-gladstone-2016-sundance-studio.jpg><p id=eyFXi2mxX7d data-wc=38>Asked about her earliest memories, Lily – who is of Siksikaitsitapi and NiMíiPuu heritage – described: "sitting on the laps of elders, spending a lot of time with grandparents, great-aunties, listening to stories [and] bringing firewood to elders."</p><p id=evLbNS72Qz1 data-wc=43>Sharing a "very close relationship" with both of her parents, Lily has credited her parents with instilling confidence in her. "They just poured so much into making sure that their overly exuberant, super-energetic, adorably chunky little girl was able to dance," she said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a48ce4bb8a7f-lily-gladstone-sundance-film-festival-2016.jpg><p id=eCSh8tu3D3X data-wc=49>"I wanted to be a ballerina, and they never told me I couldn't be, like you see in biopics, 'Oh, honey, you don't have the body for that.' They're like, yeah, you're great at it, we're gonna drive a 180-mile round trip every weekend to take you to ballet."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZxJumty8S data-wc=36>As a child, Lily's upbringing shaped her views on gender. Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> in 2023, the A-lister explained that she is comfortable with she/them pronouns, and sees this as a means of 'decolonizing gender for myself."&nbsp;</p><p id=eOm07PYtKle data-wc=31>"I remember being 9 years old and just being a little disheartened, seeing how often a lot of my boy cousins were misgendered because they wore their hair long," they explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyVOcuUROp></p><p id=eNGble2atFX data-wc=65>"It happens to a lot of kids, I think, especially Native boys leaving a community where long hair is celebrated [and then] just kind of getting teased for it," continued Lily. "So I remember back then being like, everybody should just be they. "And in most Native languages, most Indigenous languages, Blackfeet included, there are no gendered pronouns. There is no he/she, there's only they."&nbsp;</p><p id=e1kY7Gfi2ar data-wc=39>When her family were forced to move to the suburbs "for lack of economic opportunities," Lily found herself missing the "mutual reliance" of the reservations. "Everyone seemed so isolated in their little homes," she explained to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7fda0f615b92-lily-gladstone-winter-in-the-blood-premiere.jpg><p id=eT6E7_cY762M data-wc=54>But, following the move, Lily – a natural performer – was able to enrol in the Stone Soup Theatre, and she also appeared in a number of student films. Eventually, Lily went on to attend the University of Montana and graduated in 2008 with a BFA in Acting/Directing and minoring in Native American Studies.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Leonardo DiCaprio’s off-screen relationship with co-star Lily Gladstone" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a3ecac6e054d-gettyimages-1491751745.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Leonardo DiCaprio’s off-screen relationship with co-star Lily Gladstone" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Leonardo DiCaprio’s off-screen relationship with co-star Lily Gladstone</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Cara Jade Myers: I am Native American and Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon is 'groundbreaking'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c846760f02eb-carajademyers2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Cara Jade Myers: I am Native American and Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon is 'groundbreaking'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Cara Jade Myers: I am Native American and Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon is 'groundbreaking'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to watch the most talked about Oscar-nominated movies of 2024" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/aa99297918c4-oppenheimer-poor-thing-american-fiction-stills.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to watch the most talked about Oscar-nominated movies of 2024" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to watch the most talked about Oscar-nominated movies of 2024</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Rise to fame&nbsp;</h2><p id=eVG6CGLnaaIy data-wc=37>After graduating from university, Lily signed on with Living Voices, a theatre company that visited schools, performing pieces about "marginalised histories only touched on in textbooks".

"He [Leonardo] invited me over to dinner. We were sitting outside at his place with a fire going, and just talking," recalled the star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fecae17f16bf-gettyimages-1928236736.jpg><p id=eSskZkIdd7P data-wc=102>"He pulled out a packet of cigarettes, and I hadn't brought mine with me. So I was like: 'Oh, I'm sorry. Can I bum one?' So it was the two of us sharing a few cigarettes over the fire and just getting to know each other that really broke the ice. And then he said: 'This feels good. We need to put this in the film somehow. I think Ernest and Molly should smoke together.' I was like: 'Yeah, that sounds great.' A lot of ladies would have their little pipes – tobacco was very much a thing. So we enjoyed that."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55a63b682834-killers-of-the-flower-moon4.jpg><p id=eokvNp2k5aZ data-wc=68>Following the 2023 premiere of , Lily's performance was singled out by movie-goers and critics around the world, with some calling it the performance of the year. Shortly after, she was nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG Award for Best Actress, both of which she won. And, on Sunday, March 10, Lily might just add an Oscar to her ever-expanding trophy collection.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGhNYQpHnLC data-wc=60>But above all, Lily is a champion for visibility and inclusivity, and seeing the response from members of the Osage community has been a personal highlight. "It's mattered most to me what Osage people, especially the descendants of the victims and the survivors of the Reign of Terror, felt about the film," they said in an interview with the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BFI</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34179a1e2f7d-lily-gladstone.jpg><p id=eGRxaioN43A data-wc=51>"Overwhelmingly, what I was hearing from a lot of Osage people was they were just really hoping people still saw it. Because it's such an important part of history that people are so unaware of. And engaging with it like this is such a meaningful and unforgettable way of doing so."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZAwOHVgxS8u data-wc=42>For Lily, was never about finding fame. "Any excess of attention feels uncomfortable to me," she noted to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>USA Today</a>. "It's too much for one person to have as much good fortune as I've been experiencing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf388ffca09a-gettyimages-2036551250.jpg><p id=eCL6pGOnDuCj data-wc=92>Instead, it's being embraced by the Osage community that "means everything," to Lily. "Their opinion is the one that matters most ‒ maybe the only one that really does matter to me," she said. I feel like Mollie reached through time and grabbed me for this. I was offered the role on her birthday; every time I see her grandson, he calls me 'Grandma.' Because so many people signed off on me playing this role, it feels like this ongoing accountability to stay true to these significant relationships that have been formed."</p><p id=e4cQg3Q5sAvF data-wc=38>Lily added: "I really feel like I have a home in Osage County. Mollie's always going to be a part of me, and I owe it to them to always show up and be part of them, too."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Future projects &nbsp;</h2><p id=efZxhkRIaCBz data-wc=53>So, what's next for the Oscar nominee? In February 2024, it was announced that Lily had joined the cast of new sci-fi movie, The Memory Police. Marking their second collaboration with Martin Scorsese, the Gangs of New York filmmaker will serve as an executive producer.
