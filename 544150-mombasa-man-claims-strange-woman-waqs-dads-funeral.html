"It is in the family domain that she has never had a good relationship with my sister and I. My dad was very principled, and he did not want any games with his children," he added.<p class=align-left>On November 15, 2020, Felix's dad fell sick; initially, he was suspected to have <a href=#>COVID-19</a> and had to be isolated at the hospital. When Felix's dad was being prepared for treatment, he asked for his son, but they never told the young man who was just waiting outside the hospital.</p><h2>Strange woman predicts Felix's death</h2><p class=align-left>Prior to his dad's death, Felix claims that his stepmother used to block him and even prevent him from getting money from his dad. Ultimately, Felix's dad died without seeing his son; they only used to communicate through the hospital's system.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/de5afda768d94090.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Soldier In Tears As Girlfriend Dumps Him For Another Man, Video Goes Viral</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When they arrived with his dad's body at home, it was pitch dark, and the strangest thing was that the power blackout had only happened in their home.</p>"As I was ensuring everything was okay, the voice of a lady came to my ear and said you see, a degree has gone into the soil, yours is coming soon," said Felix. "When I turned, I saw a woman melt into the shadows," he added.<p class=align-left>Despite the strange encounter, Felix and his family laid their dad to rest. At the funeral, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a> Ports Authority personnel announced that they were going to give him work since his dad had been their employer.</p><h2>Voices in Felix's head</h2><p class=align-left>Apparently, it was a huge mistake announcing the matter in front of everyone as Felix never knew peace from that day.</p>"I used to hear voices and even took up a lot of drinking; I would sell everything in the house after my wife went to work," he shared.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/466166f41129e89c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nandi Family Seeks Justice After Missing Son Is Found Dead, Body Dumped in Bush</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Christabel, Felix's wife, shared that he struggled with alcohol, and sometimes, he wanted to kill her.</p>"He said the voices used to tell him to kill me because I was a prayer warrior. I never used to welcome people to my house for fear that they would advise me wrongly about leaving him," she said. "I wanted to take him back home, but his sister said that would kill him. According to a pastor who prayed for him, someone had used witchcraft on Felix because the day his dad died, Kenya Ports Authority had offered him a job, and this didn't go well with people who had attended the funeral," Christabel explained.<h2>Christabel stands by Felix</h2><p class=align-left>Many would mock them, especially when he used to pick papers. He denied pregnancy because his stepmother told him he would never have a home or a child.</p>"We have really visited churches, but it didn't help. He even used to beat me up while I was pregnant, and whenever he brought papers home, he would insist it was shopping and beat me when I contradicted him," shared the devoted wife. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3ddbabe3069a059f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nyandarua Man Who Dumped Wife Jailed after Lady He Proposed to Turns out to Be High School Student</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A pastor encouraged Christabel to leave her husband, but she left the church instead.</p><p class=align-left>One day, after his wife left their door ajar, Felix went to church, and after the preaching, pastor Joseph of Jesus Winner Ministry said God would heal him.</p>"After praying for me, the pastor said the best thing would be to hide me at the pulpit. He took me to Bishop Mwai's crusade in Kasarani and prayed for me," said Felix.<p class=align-left>Felix is now healed, doing well for himself and preaching at the church. Despite his degree in social work, he has yet to get a job.</p><h2>Christabel pleads with Kenyans to help Felix</h2>"My husband applies for jobs, but he has never found any. I sell water to make ends meet, and our pastor gives us some money because he knows we are not earning much," said Christabel.<p class=align-left>From being mentally challenged, Felix is now a preacher and pastor Joseph is grooming him slowly.
