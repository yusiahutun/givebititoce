Scott and Kourtney—who share three kids, Mason, Penelope and Reign—went on to date on and off for nine years before their final breakup in 2015. Kourtney went on to get engaged to her longtime <a href=# rel=noopener>neighbor, Travis Barker</a>, while Scott went on to date several models almost half his age.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/scott-disick-kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-pregnancy.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sofia-richie-elliot-grainge.png><p>During the Keeping Up With the Kardashians series finale reunion in 2021, Scott explained why so many of his girlfriends have been so young. “Everybody gets this wrong, that I look for young girls,” Scott said. “I don’t go out looking for young girls. They happen to be attracted to me. Because I look young.”</p><p>In October 2023, Kris Jenner probed him on his dating life. “So, are you seeing anyone?” she asked directly.&nbsp;“Well, I’m dying to know,” she said, raising her eyebrows. “It’s the question everyone wants to know,” and he spoke about the type of woman he’s looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, Khloe asked his daughter, 11-year-old Penelope, what she thinks her dad should look for. “Older,” she quipped. “You’re&nbsp;40!” she said. “You’re not gonna date someone (who is) 19.” Scott replied:&nbsp;“Well, I would,” to which Khloe agreed.&nbsp;“Yeah, he would, but we got to get over it because you’re not going to find the girl you want.”</p><p>So who is <a href=# id=auto-tag_scott-disick data-tag=scott-disick>Scott Disick</a>‘s girlfriend and who is he dating now? Read on for details about Scott’s current relationship and why his past girlfriends—including two celebrity daughters—didn’t work out.</p><h2>Who’s Scott Disick’s girlfriend now?</h2><p>Meet Scott Disick’s girlfriends past and present and see his current relationships.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kimberly Stewart (2022)</h2><p>Kimberly Stewart is reportedly dating Scott Disick according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly.</a> The outlet reported on August 24, 2022, that the two have been seeing each other and are keeping it under wraps for now. A source told them that they have been “dating for a few months,” and are “really into each other.” The two have known each other for “years” and met through Kimberly’s brother, Sean Stewart. The source confirmed, “They had the same friend group and hung out in the same circle.”</p><p>The source explained that they waited a while before they “decided to go public,” and confirmed that they weren’t “serious yet,” but they have been “getting to know each other in a different way than seeing each other as friends. ”Before his<a href=# rel=noopener> car crash</a>, Scott was spotted holding hands with her while leaving Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, California, on Sunday, August 21, according to photos obtained by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Daily Mail</a>. The two sparked dating rumors back in 2015 following his split from Kourtney Kardashian, but Kimberly’s mother dispelled those rumors by saying they were just friends</p><h2>Rebecca Donaldson (2022)</h2><p>Scott Disick and his new girlfriend, Rebecca Donaldson, were first spotted on a date on April 5, 2022. The 27-year-old model and the 38-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum made their red carpet debut at Hulu’s The Kardashians premiere a couple of days later on April 7, 2022. Scott and Rebecca walked the carpet at his ex’s family show for their first official outing together.</p><p>Rebecca is a model signed to M±P Models in the UK and mostly models in Europe. It is not known how long the couple has been dating. At the premiere, the couple had friendly interactions with Kim Kardashian’s boyfriend Pete Davidson, Malika Haqq and Khadijah Haqq McCray. According to eyewitnesses who spoke to Entertainment Tonight, the couple did not mingle with Scott’s ex, Kourtney, who held a wedding ceremony with her new husband Travis Barker just days earlier on April 4, 2022.</p><h2>Hanna Cross (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hanna-Cross.jpg><p>Scott Disick and Hanna Cross, a British model 14 years younger than him, were first linked on November 8, 2021, when they were seen at Nobu in Malibu, California. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a> reported at the time that Scott and Hanna tried to stay under the radar. For the date, Scott wore a black baseball cap, a hoodie and a green puffer vest, while Hanna dressed in a blue blazer, matching slacks and a white cropped tube top.</p><p>Scott isn’t Hanna’s first public relationship. She also dated Brooklyn Beckham, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, for a year in 2019. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in 2021 that Scott and Hanna weren’t serious, as she was his first relationship after his breakup with his ex-girlfriend, Amelia Hamlin, and after his other ex-girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian’s engagement to her then-fiancé, Travis Barker. “[Scott is] getting back out on the dating scene and enjoying himself,” the insider said. “He’s having fun with Hana but that’s all it is for now.”</p><h2>Amelia Hamlin (2020 – 2021)</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Amelia-Hamlin-Scott-Disick.jpg></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Scott Disick and Amelia Hamlin</a>, the daughter of <a href=# rel=noopener>Lisa Rinna</a> and Harry Hamlin, dated from October 2020 to September 2021. Amelia, who is 18 years younger than Scott, broke up with him after <a href=# rel=noopener>Younes Bendjima</a>—the ex-boyfriend of Scott’s ex-girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian—leaked a DM from him, where he slammed Kourtney and her then-boyfriend, Travis Barker. “Yo is this chick ok!????? Brooo like what is this. In the middle of Italy,” the message read, along with a photo of Kourtney and Travis kissing in Italy. Amelia’s mother, Lisa Rinna, explained during The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 11 reunion at the time that the DM was one of the reasons for the split but not the only reason. “There’s never one reason why I think people split up. You know, now’s the time to heal. Now’s the time for everyone to heal,” she said.</p><h2>Sofia Richie (2017 – 2020)</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scott-Disick-Sofia-Richie.jpg></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Scott Disick and Sofia Richie</a>, the daughter of Lionel Richie, dated on and off for three years from 2017 to 2020. During an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians season 20, Scott claimed that he broke up with Sofia after she gave him an “ultimatum” about his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Kourtney Kardashian. “I thought I would give it a try and make her more of a priority, but then even when doing that, I feel like she just started wanting to push Kourtney out,” Scott said at the time. “And I said like, that’s the most important thing to me is my kids and that’s my family, and the only family I have, including you guys along with it.” He continued, “She was like, ‘I don’t want to share you as a boyfriend with Kourtney.'”</p><p>A source, however, told OK! magazine at the time that Scott was 100 percent honest with the reason for their split. “It seems like Scott’s desperate for attention because of his enormous ego,” the insider said. The source also claimed that Sofia thought Scott was “twisting the truth” about their breakup to amp up the drama for KUWTK‘s final season. “The way Sofia sees it, she was way more accepting of Kourtney and the kids than Kourtney was of her,” the insider said.</p><h2>Kourtney Kardashian (2006 – 2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kourtney-Kardashian-Scott-Disick.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian</a> dated for almost a decade from 2006 to 2015. They met in 2006 at a party hosted by Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis in Mexico. Their on-again, off-again relationship became a main storyline when Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered a year later in October 2007. Kourtney and Scott went on to welcome three children together—sons Mason and Reign and daughter Penelope—before their breakup in 2015. During the Keeping Up With the Kardashians final season reunion in 2021, Kourtney revealed that Scott’s drug issues were the reason for their split and not his infidelity. “The infidelity, I only knew about it at the end, so I think the substance abuse was the deal breaker,” she said. Scott also admitted during the reunion to his misbehavior. “I don’t want to make any excuses for my behavior,” he said. “I definitely wouldn’t have done these things sober, but it was all wrong. I just thought it was normal, to be honest.” In 2021, Kourtney got engaged to her longtime neighbor, Travis Barker.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.
