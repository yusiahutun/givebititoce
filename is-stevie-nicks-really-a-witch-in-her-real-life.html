From her fashion accessories to the themes of her discography, some would say that she’s into some voodoo stuff.</p><p><a href=#>Her unusual connection with</a> the occult sparked <a href=#>rumors that she might be</a> an actual witch. But is she really, though? Or is it just some artistic expression?</p><p>In this article, we’re going to investigate the roots of those speculations and find out what<strong> Stevie Nicks has to say about them. </strong>So, if you’re interested to know more about that, keep reading!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Stevie_Nicks_is_a_Witch_Rumors_How_It_All_Began><strong>“Stevie Nicks is a Witch” Rumors: How It All Began</strong></span></h2><p>It all started when Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks’ band at the time, released a song called Rhiannon in 1976. The song’s lyrics are pretty much self-explanatory, and it was obvious that the song had something to do with the dark arts. Cats, flying, darkness – these are closely related to witchcraft.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When asked about the inspiration behind the song, Stevie Nicks said:</strong></p><p>“It was just a stupid little paperback that I found somewhere at somebody’s house, lying on the couch. It was called Triad [written by Mary Leader] and it was all about this girl who becomes possessed by a spirit named Rhiannon. I read the book, but I was so taken with that name that I thought: ‘I’ve got to write something about this.’ So I sat down at the piano and started this song about a woman that was all involved with these birds and magic.”</p><p>Stevie further clarified that she initially was not aware of the goddess who goes by the same name as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rhiannon</a>. However, the eerie coincidence added a layer of mysticism to the song, which Stevie welcomed.&nbsp;</p><p>As time went on, Stevie started to embrace the gyspy character of her and started writing more songs about different mythologies. Her fashion sense even involved a few rings, bracelets, and clothes that really resembled a modern-day witch.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, things started to backfire when people started taking her aesthetic seriously.<a href=#> Rumors of Stevie</a> practicing actual voodoo rituals started to spread.</p><p>This led the Gypsy singer to start fearing for her life, believing that people might actually hurt her for engaging with the dark arts – if that was ever true.</p><p>So, Stevie decided to drop everything related to witchcraft and started wearing anything but black. But even then, people wouldn’t stop accusing her of being an actual witch – and Stevie has had enough.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Stevie_Nicks_Response_to_Witch_Rumors><strong>Stevie Nicks’ Response to Witch Rumors</strong></span></h2><p>To set the records straight once and for all, Stevie explicitly denied ever being part of the occult in multiple interviews. In one interview, she said:</p><p>“I do not believe in witchcraft as a natural philosophy at all. I just think it’s fun. And I love black clothes and I love moons and stars and Merlin hats and Mickey Mouse. But no, I do not believe in that side of it at all.”</p><p><strong>In other words, Stevie Nicks is not a witch.</strong> The reason for her mystic songs and weird pendants is that she finds them appealing – nothing else. The same way some people like wearing Adidas shoes even though they’re not athletic. As what the kids today would say: “It’s an aesthetic!”</p><p>Eventually, Stevie did return to wearing black clothes. According to her, she wears them not because she’s a witch, but because it makes her look thinner.</p><p>Plus, she stopped paying attention to the baseless accusations being thrown at her. But she does have a message to all the people out there who still believe in the witch rumors:</p><p>“I wish people would stop thinking about that, because I spent thousands of dollars on beautiful black clothes and had to stop wearing them for a long time, because a lot of people scared me.”</p><p>So, will you all please let the poor old woman wear her black clothes? And give the witch rumors a rest, already! <strong>Stevie Nicks is perfectly content with<a href=#> her $90million net worth</a></strong> and we’re pretty sure that she’ll have no trouble suing anyone for defamation. <a href=#>Let the girl live her life!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FHmqynrF6YvK57yKxkrKyVq7amec2imqSrXaeyorjLsmSaZaeewaS0jKKlZqCVp3qzscClZKWhlpp8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-stevie-nicks-really-a-witch-in-her-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-stevie-nicks-really-a-witch-in-her-real-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-stevie-nicks-really-a-witch-in-her-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-stevie-nicks-really-a-witch-in-her-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-stevie-nicks-really-a-witch-in-her-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-stevie-nicks-really-a-witch-in-her-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jo-dee-messina-mother-mary-messina-dead.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jo-dee-messina-mother-mary-messina-dead.html>Jo Dee Messina Mourning Death of Her Mother, Mary Messina</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./country-singer-ray-price-dies-18671.html>Country Singer Ray Price Dies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./country-singer-ray-price-dies-18671.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
