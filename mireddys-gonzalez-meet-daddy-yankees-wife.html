The retired Puerto Rican rapper has disclosed in his interviews that he owes his success to his wife, who has supported his passion for music since they met as teenagers.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, fans of the rapper are curious to know more about his wife. Here’s what we know about Daddy Yankee’s wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-25_03-49-35-fotor-2023092535731.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Daddy_Yankees_Wife></span>Who Is Daddy Yankee’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born on January 19, 1977, Mireddys González is 46 years old. Although she is of Hispanic ethnic background, Daddy Yankee’s wife was born in the United States. However, her famous husband was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In addition, she is a public figure and a music executive.</p><p>However, she has not revealed any details regarding her upbringing. Hence, there are no details regarding her educational background and achievements. Similarly, little is known about her parents and siblings, as she has yet to reveal their identities. However, online reports suggest she has a brother, Milton González.</p><p>Since she became spotlighted, Daddy Yankee’s wife has kept her private life away from the media. Despite the fame, she rarely makes public appearances and prefers to see her husband get all the attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-25_03-49-44-fotor-2023092535957.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Mireddys_Gonzalez_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Mireddys González Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aside from being the wife of a famous rapper, Mireddys González is a career-driven woman with an impressive history. She is a successful businesswoman and talent manager. González began her career in the entertainment industry in the early 2000s as her husband’s publicist.</p><p>However, she later transitioned to become the famous Puerto Rican rapper’s manager and has since played a significant role in her husband’s successful career. In addition, González became the Chief Executive Officer of El Cartel Records, which she co-founded with her husband in 2001.</p><p>As the CEO of the record label, Mireddys González played a crucial role in the growth and success of the brand, overseeing the production and distribution of numerous hit records by artists such as Daddy Yankee, Wisin & Yandel, and Ivy Queen.</p><p>Under her leadership, El Cartel Records became one of the industry’s most successful Latin music labels. In addition, González has worked as the executive producer of several music videos and television shows, including the popular reality show “La Kalle” and the music video for Daddy Yankee’s hit song “Gasolina.”</p><p>However, after her husband retired from music, González dabbled into business. She co-owns a company with her friend, Michelle Matos. Her company, Hi Body, offers products that help with weight loss. The 46-year-old celebrity spouse says she came up with the business idea after she lost 23 pounds using Hi Body products. In addition, González runs an initiative to motivate other women with her partner, Matos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-25_03-49-51-fotor-2023092535847.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Daddy_Yankee_and_His_Wife_Tie_the_Knot></span>When Did Daddy Yankee and His Wife Tie the Knot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “Gasolina” singer met his wife very young and began a romantic relationship. As their love story continued to unfold, González and Daddy Yankee decided to tie the knot when they were both 17. The lovebirds exchanged vows in a private ceremony with their close friends and family on March 20, 1995.</p><p>However, they kept their marriage a secret from the public eye for many years. The couple revealed their marital status during an interview with María Celeste Arrarás in “Al Rojo Vivo,” where they told the world of their commitment to each other.</p><p>Mireddys González became Daddy Yankee’s wife over 28 years ago, and their union has stood the test of time. Unlike some celebrity couples, <a href=#>Daddy Yankee</a> and his wife have kept their marriage scandal-free, and they appear to wax stronger.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Mireddys_Gonzalez_Have_Children></span>Does Mireddys González Have Children?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, she does. Daddy Yankee’s wife is a mother of three. However, rumors surround the birth of their first daughter, Yamilet. While some reports claim Mireddys González is Yamilet’s birth mother, others claim she’s not. However, the couple has neither confirmed nor debunked the rumors.</p><p>Nevertheless, the couple welcomed their first daughter, <a href=#>Yamilet Ayala González</a>, in 1994 when they were just teenagers. Daddy Yankee described her birth as “confusing” and added that raising a daughter at that age was a challenging experience. Afterward, the couple welcomed their second daughter, Jesaaelys Ayala Gonzalez, in June 1996 and had their third child and son, Jeremy Ayala Gonzalez, in May 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-25_03-49-57-fotor-2023092535815.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Mireddys_Gonzalez_Now></span>Where Is Mireddys González Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although she and her husband tied the knot over two decades ago, they have been together ever since. While there is no doubt that Mireddys González contributed to her husband’s international star status, she prefers to remain behind the scenes. Consequently, González rarely makes red-carpet appearances with <a href=#>Daddy Yankee</a> as she doesn’t want to share in his spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqq%2BxJ2bsqtdnLyvxsClnLNlnZqytXnDmpudsV2urq%2B3xJ6qZq%2BZm7Jw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmireddys-gonzalez-meet-daddy-yankees-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmireddys-gonzalez-meet-daddy-yankees-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmireddys-gonzalez-meet-daddy-yankees-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmireddys-gonzalez-meet-daddy-yankees-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmireddys-gonzalez-meet-daddy-yankees-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmireddys-gonzalez-meet-daddy-yankees-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paige-vanzant-slams-haters-adult-31370567.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paige-vanzant-slams-haters-adult-31370567.html>Paige VanZant slams haters of adult switch content in racy 'talk s**t' Instagram post</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kim-kardashian-flaunts-post-baby-figure-leather-skirt.html>Kim Kardashian flaunts her incredible post-baby figure in lace-up leather dress</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kim-kardashian-flaunts-post-baby-figure-leather-skirt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
