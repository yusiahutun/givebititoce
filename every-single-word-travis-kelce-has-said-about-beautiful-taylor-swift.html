They are already busy digging into everything Kelce has said about the Lover crooner throughout the years. Kelce is also getting extra brownie points for incorporating Taylor Swift’s lyrics while talking about the history maker <a href=#>celebrity</a> recently in a podcast.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1712341185-1-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-every-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-taylor-swift>Every single word Travis Kelce has said about Taylor Swift</h2><p>Travis Kelce can’t help but praise the pop queen, and we understand! The 33-year-old football player has been a ‘fan’ of Taylor for years. As rumors about the two being an item become major, <a href=#>music</a> fans are bringing out old videos of Kelce swooning over the singer. So here’s a list of everything beautiful that Kelce has said about Miss Americana hitmaker so far.</p><p>In an interview dated back to 2016, Kelce was asked to play Kiss, Marry or Kill. He had to choose between <a href=#>celebrity</a> bombshells Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, and Taylor Swift … and he chose Taylor to kiss!</p><p>Sorry, Ariana Grande, you were chosen to ‘kill’, in the game. But, we don’t think she’ll be too upset, as she’s rumored to be seeing her <a href=#>co-star after her recent divorce</a>.</p><p>In February, he was spotted signing along to lyrics of his songs. He obviously needed to study beforehand.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2023, Kelce attended Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in July and even made a friendship bracelet for her. But luck was still not in his favor as he could not meet Tay Tay that day.</p><p>Recalling his Eras tour experience, Kelce said in an interview: “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after the show because she as to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings… I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets that I made for her.”</p><p>Then in September, he told Pat McAfee’s show he ‘threw’ the ball into Taylor’s court.</p><p>“It’s life, baby,” he said. “I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court. I said, “I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead, and see which one’s a little more lit.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-looked-amazing>“She looked amazing”</h2><p>Before the 33-year-old broke the internet by watching a football game, Travis spoke about her.</p><p>Travis’ brother Jason questioned him about his mustache and whether he had ‘found out what Taylor Swift thinks’ of it. This was during their <a href=# rel=nofollow>New Heights podcast</a> on <a href=#>YouTube</a> in August.</p><p>The 33-year-old Chiefs star laughed at first. But he then said: “We’re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode, but something tells me she’s gonna like it.” Can he read the future now?</p><p>The previous Eras tour letdown could not stop him from trying again, though. And this time, he succeeded! The Kansas City Chiefs tight end then invited the twelve-time Grammy <a href=#>Award show</a> winner to his turf to watch a match. He was awe-struck at the response that he received post-match!</p><p>Speaking of the game day, Kelce later shared: “I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light!”</p><p>The day went ‘perfect’, said the man of the hour, adding that he was also amazed seeing Taylor bonding with everyone, from slow-motion chest bumps to high-fives with his mom.</p><p>Swifties also remembers the cinematic moment of Kelce and Taylor riding in the ‘getaway car’ afterward. He himself swooned: “…and then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-friendship-bracelet-is-a-tradition-now>“Friendship bracelet’ is a tradition now</h2><p>Travis Kelce is putting his own stamp on the Eras tour Friendship bracelet tradition now.</p><p>A new <a href=#>TikTok</a> video from NFL shows Kelce made some friendship bracelets for his team members, and they swapped them in the locker room.</p><p>So it is safe to say, that Taylor Swift fans are looking at another man who could ‘wreck her plans’ and we can’t wait to see Travis and Taylor becoming the endgame!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2V%2FcLHVnqmyZaOeu6i4xGauqKqUYsGzrdWiqmajlaGwpnnHmqpmq5GesW6twaisrWWSmq62wMifrKVlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-beautiful-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fevery-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-beautiful-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fevery-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-beautiful-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fevery-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-beautiful-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-beautiful-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-single-word-travis-kelce-has-said-about-beautiful-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katy-perry-and-orlando-blooms-daughter-has-fans-crying-with-adorable-public-debut.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katy-perry-and-orlando-blooms-daughter-has-fans-crying-with-adorable-public-debut.html>Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's daughter has fans 'crying' with 'adorable' public debut</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eugenio-derbez.html>Eugenio Derbez</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eugenio-derbez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
