has suffered a 'tremendous amount of casualties'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>Russia has claimed to have captured a small village just five miles away from the major city of Bakhmut after months of fighting in a 'meat-grinder' offensive designed to push further in Ukraine's Donbas region.</a></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the village of Klishchiivka, which is located nine kilometers south of Bakhmut, had been 'liberated.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The claim couldn't be independently verified, and Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment on the claim.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It comes as <a style=font-weight:700 href=#

class=mol-para-with-font>Taking Klishchiivka would be only a minor breakthrough, but the Kremlin is hungry for good news from the battlefield after months of setbacks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It follows Ukrainian troops' withdrawal from Soledar, a mining town which has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The town has been attacked for months on end by Russia's infamous Wagner group, which has reportedly seen extremely heavy losses and has seen a massive recruitment drive among serious criminals stuck in Russian prisons.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Russia first claimed to have taken Soledar a week ago, but this was heavily contested by Ukrainian officials who said fighting remained ongoing in the area until admitting its troops withdrew yesterday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was the first tangible territory victory for Russia in months as Putin continues his attempts to capture the Donbas region, with&nbsp;Bakhmut representing an opportunity to Russia to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines in the east and threaten other Ukrainian-held cities in the surrounding Donestk region.</p><img
