Lynette Nusbacher? Well, she is a transgender female and one of the most famous transgender women in Europe. Before her change, the military expert had an identity crisis. Therefore, changing her gender at 41 was a brave decision, considering she was already a public intellectual.</p><p class=align-left>Her transition has been a conversation starter regarding gender identity, both in the USA and UK. For example, her new status was instrumental in addressing transphobia in modern society and specifically in academia.</p><h3>When did Lynette Nusbacher become a woman?</h3><p class=align-left>She changed her gender to a woman in 2007. While she has changed physically and dropped the name Aryeh, her passion for knowledge has remained.</p><p class=align-left>While many people did not believe her at first, it became evident from the few pictures online and on her social media accounts that she is transgender. She rarely posted pictures during her time as a male. However, there are many similarities in Dr Lynette Nusbacher before and after photos.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/65c281c4c22b748b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ali Vitali: husband, wedding, nationality, net worth, salary</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ea77be8964019f25.jpg><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Dr Lynette Nusbacher education has enabled her to work in different continents and, more importantly, study military interventions from a scholarly point of view.

Over the years, she has written books that detail her views on the same. She has published a number of them, including:</p><h4>1. Battle of Bannockburn 1314, and War and Conflict</h4><p class=align-left>The book is one of the most-read publications by Dr Lynette. The central theme in this book is the Scottish war of 1314.

A contributor at "Time of Israel."</h4><p class=align-left>The <i>Time of Israel</i> is an online publication on war and politics. Dr Lynette is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">regular contributor</a> as a specialist on war, Aleppo refugees and UNRWA. Given her specialisation in the field and her unbiased approach, she has placed herself in a better position to offer insightful views without bias.</p><h3>Dr Lynette Nusbacher as a panellist at History Channel and BBC</h3><p class=align-left>Before her gender reassignment, Dr Lynette was a regular panellist at different History Channel's discussions on war and politics. Her views on military politics and bombings gave people another way to look at international conflicts, especially when military interventions are concerned.
