'They were very supportive to Shawn.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, the American gymnast received almost as much cheering from the crowd as her Chinese counterparts. And Beijing native Chow also received staunch support from his family in the hometown he has not seen for 14 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I caught up with my grandparents and aunty and uncle, and they were all happy for me,' Chow said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Turning from an athlete into a trainer is like standing at the starting line again,' he said. 'From having nothing when I immigrated to the United States, to successfully training an Olympic gold medallist, I felt a great sense of achievement.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eighteen years ago, when he was still known as Qiao Liang, the then 23-year-old former co-captain of a winning Chinese men's gymnastics team chose adventure over the highly regulated but stable coaching life available in China. He left for the US, where he studied English at the University of Iowa while teaching gymnastics on the side.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I was still young and I wanted to see the world,' said Chow.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By then he had already won numerous national and international titles, from all-around to single-beam to floor exercise; all he lacked was an Olympic medal. Living by the motto 'a soldier who does not aspire to become a general is not a good soldier', Chow fulfilled his goal of setting up his own gym in 1988, even though it was next to a warehouse in West Des Moines, Iowa, a city of 50,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was in his small neighbourhood gymnasium - Chow's Gymnastics and Dance Institute - that he met Shawn Johnson, a bouncy, toothless six-year-old who would later consider him her 'second father'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chow and his wife Zhuang Liwen, who teaches dance and choreography, have nurtured 232 individual state champions and won the gymnasium 16 state titles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the superstar is undoubtedly Johnson, whose debut appearance at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships last year impressed the world with three golds, including the individual all-around.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A product of a strict state-operated training machine, Chow has adopted a completely different training schedule for Johnson. She trains with Chow for only about four hours a day, allowing her to attend a public school like a normal child.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The techniques Chow has taught Johnson were, however, drawn from his Chinese experience. He believes this combination of Chinese elements - grace, meticulousness and high technical standards - and her powerful western physique gave Johnson the edge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'She likes the Chinese elements of gymnastics very much and she is a perfect combination,' said the coach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not only were the Chinese elements exemplified in her routines, but also in her friendship with the Chinese gymnastics team. When China's Cheng Fei fell while performing her floor exercise during the team competition, Johnson was one of the first to give her a hug.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I'm still very close with the Chinese gymnastics team,' Chow said. 'Without their training, I wouldn't have my knowledge and achievement today. I learned all my skills from them. We are competitors in the arena, but we are friends off the arena.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chow is one of a growing number of Chinese coaches leading foreign teams which beat China in its traditional strongholds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Steel hammer' Chinese volleyball spiker Lang Ping led the US team to victory over China in the Olympics group qualifiers - although her success left many mainlanders questioning her new allegiance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other coaches who have excelled offshore include Australia's diving coach Tong Hui, South Korea's badminton boss Li Mao and Singapore's table tennis coach Liu Guodong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdman1xgI9onLFlk52urrzIqKVmm5%2BisrR5x6iknmWXobyzxQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fex-champion-comes-home-glory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fex-champion-comes-home-glory.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fex-champion-comes-home-glory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fex-champion-comes-home-glory.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fex-champion-comes-home-glory.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fex-champion-comes-home-glory.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kristen-bell-dax-shepard-los-angeles-home-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kristen-bell-dax-shepard-los-angeles-home-photos.html>Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard's $4.3m love nest's shock Playboy Mansion link photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carol-d-leonnig-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-married-husband.html>Carol D.Leonnig Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Married &amp;amp; Husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carol-d-leonnig-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-married-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
