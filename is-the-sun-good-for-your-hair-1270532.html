But all that covering up may mean that you are missing out on some great sun benefits for hair, most importantly, in the context of vitamin D supply.

This begs the question, is the sun good for your hair?&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is not a clear yes or no — prolonged exposure to direct sunlight has been proven to cause hair damage, including roughness, split ends, and loss of hair color, even for darker hair. On the flip side, early morning and evening sun exposure may help promote hair growth and health. So, there are caveats, as with all else in life.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's dig deeper and understand why and how (much) basking in sunlight can be a treat for your mane.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What Effect Can Sun Exposure Have on Your Hair?</strong></h3><p><img alt="What Effect Can Sun Exposure Have on Your Hair?" title="What Effect Can Sun Exposure Have on Your Hair?" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-01/1704869185_pexels-iiii-iiii-54566.jpg></p><p>Prolonged or excessive sun exposure, i.e., to the ultraviolet rays of the sun, namely UVA and UVB,&nbsp; can damage hair protein (keratin) and pigments in hair (melanin), respectively. This broadly means that UVA exposure can damage the structure and integrity of hair strands, while UVB exposure can strip the hair of melanin and lead to graying of hair and loss of color vibrance (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Is the Sun Good for Your Hair: Making a Case for the Sunshine Vitamin","1270532","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19138021/#:~:text=Excessive%20sun%20exposition%20is%20the,wavelengths%20of%20254%2D400%20nm.","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/is-the-sun-good-for-your-hair-1270532","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>1</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>However,&nbsp; in measured doses of exposure, sunlight can brighten your tresses with natural highlights and supply a good dose of vitamin D.&nbsp;</p><p>The most commonly discussed benefit that you derive from being outdoors, basking in the warmth of the sun, lies in the production of the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D, in the layers of the skin (and scalp, by extension).
