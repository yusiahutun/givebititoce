He was a star player during his college years, famous for his defensive play and shot blocking, which even forced the NCAA to institute a basketball interference rule.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Russell started his professional basketball career by representing the U.S. men’s basketball team in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.

His second spouse was Dorothy Anstett, a <a href=#>beauty queen</a> famous for being crowned Miss Washington USA in 1968.</p><p class=align-left>The couple tied the knot in 1977, but their marriage was short-lived, with the couple divorcing in 1980.

He also earned a substantial income as a basketball coach and later a TV commentator.</p><h2>Fight against racism</h2><p class=align-left>Russell’s life was marred by incidences of racism from when he was a child in Louisiana to his college and even NBA career. For example, during the 1954 All-College Tournament, Russell and his fellow black players at USF were denied hotel accommodation in Oklahoma City for being black.</p><p class=align-left>He was also subjected to racial abuse and discrimination when playing for Bolton Celtics, including harassment from overzealous Celtics fans. Other instances include the 1958 off-season NBA-ALL-Stars tour, where Russell and other black teammates were denied hotel accommodation in North Carolina.</p><p class=align-left>A similar scenario occurred in the 1961/62 exhibition game, where he and other black teammates were refused service in a restaurant in Lexington, Kentucky.
