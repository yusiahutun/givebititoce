<time>15 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green is an American up-and-coming actor. However, he became famous as the son of talented actors and ex-couple Brian Austin Green and Vanessa Marcil. His father, Brian, is a renowned actor, best known for his portrayal of David Silver on the TV series “Beverly Hills, 90210.”</p><p>Similarly, the young actor’s mom is a talented actress known for her role as Gina Kincaid on “Beverly Hills, 90210.” While Kassius’ parents never cease to wow fans with their incredible acting, they seem to have passed on their skills to their son. Like his parents, Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green is making a name for himself as an actor.</p><p>Although the celebrity kid keeps a low profile, he has been in the news lately due to the constant bickering between his parents and his controversial relationship. Here’s a peek into the life of the celebrity kid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-12_03-38-57-fotor-20231012472.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Kassius_Lijah_Marcil-Green></span>How Old Is Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green is 21 years old. The budding actor, who describes himself as “potentially iconic,” was born on March 15, 2002, in Los Angeles, California, United States. Thanks to his dad, he has mixed English, Scottish, French, Dutch, and Italian roots. In addition, he has French, English, German, Mexican, and Canadian roots from his mom.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he holds American nationality and follows the Christian faith. Due to his parent’s separation, Kassius grew up with his mom away from the limelight. Consequently, most details about his early life and educational background elude the media. But after graduating high school, he studied Theatre Arts and Acting in College.</p><p>According to reports, Brian named his son Kassius after his favorite boxer, the late Muhammad Ali, whose first name was Cassius. However, despite providing an excellent name for his son, the “Beverly Hills, 90210” actor could not provide Kassius with the love and care he needed as a child. In 2018, Vanessa Marcil claimed that her ex-boyfriend had “cut off” Kassius from his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-12_03-38-47-fotor-2023101235413.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Kassius_Lijah_Marcil-Greens_Parents></span>What Happened Between Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian Austin Green and Vanessa Marcil met while filming “Beverly Hills, 90210.” The two started dating after meeting on set in 1999. After dating for about two years, the then-couple announced their engagement in July 2001. However, they split in 2003, a year after the birth of Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green, citing irreconcilable differences. Both of Kassius’ parents had different viewpoints regarding child support.&nbsp;</p><p>Since their son was just a year old when they separated, Marcil got custody of their son. Following their split, Brian married renowned actress Megan Fox, with whom he shares three sons. However, the duo divorced in 2021 after nearly a decade of marriage. Since the divorce, Brian has been dating Australian dancer Sharna Burgess.</p><p>Similarly, Vanessa Marcil married actor Carmine Giovinazzo and reportedly engaged a California Deputy Sheriff, MC Martin, in April 2015 after her separation from Giovinazzo. However, in 2018, the renowned actress claimed that her ex-fiance dragged her to court multiple times, asking for their son until 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-12_03-39-10-fotor-202310124239-718x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Brian_Austin_Greens_First_Son_Do></span>What Does Brian Austin Green’s First Son Do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like most celebrity kids, Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green’s apple didn’t fall far from the tree.

He has also played minor roles in “The Night They Came Home,” “Bryce,” “Dirty Cleaners,” and “Christmas Gals.” In addition, reports suggest Kassius and his father are collaborating on a movie.</p><p>In 2022, <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a> shared a photo of himself and his son on the set of their film, “Rufus.” There are no details regarding the movie, and it does not appear to have a release date yet. However, the famous actor shared another photo from their project in October 2022, praising his son and recounting his experience working with him. “Working with Kass on a movie titled ‘Rufus.’ Such a great experience!!” Brian wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Kassius_Lijah_Marcil-Green_Gay></span>Is Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he is.
