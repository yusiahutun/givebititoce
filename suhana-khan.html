Monaghan. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>)</p><p>Amidst the conversation, Michelle opened up about her journey from modeling to acting. Initially studying journalism, she found herself drawn to the world of modeling during a period of grounding.&nbsp;</p><p>A family trip to Chicago, where she witnessed the bustling city life and skyline, ignited a passion for a different future. Faced with the realization that if she wanted to attend college, she would have to finance it herself, Michelle seized the opportunity presented by her looks.&nbsp;</p><p>Encouraged by those around her, she ventured into modeling, working for retailers like Montgomery Ward and Target.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle’s journey to success is attributed to her parents’ relentless work ethic and the values instilled in her during her formative years. Gad, in expressing admiration, highlighted her tenacity and willingness to fight for everything, a trait she attributes to her upbringing.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Her parents’ hard work and the realization that nothing would be handed to her instilled in Michelle a sense of empowerment.
