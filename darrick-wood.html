Like few people who tend to get public and media attention, Darrick is one of those who came to the limelight after marrying a well-known figure in the US.&nbsp;</h3><h2>Who Is Darrick Wood's Spouse? Does He Have Kids With His Wife?</h2><p>Darrick Wood is a happily married man with his wife, <strong>Damaris Phillips</strong>. His partner Damaris is an American chef and television personality.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/18/darrick-wood--1581986423.jpg width=450 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Darrick Wood has been married to his wife and celebrity chef Damaris Phillips since 2015.&nbsp;</span></strong><p>Darrick first met his wife at one of their mutual friend's wedding and stumbled upon each other.

The grand wedding ceremony was attended by more than two hundred guests with, of course, a variety of food items on the menu.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Darrick Share Any Children With His Wife, Damaris?</h2><p>Since their wedding in 2015, the husband and wife have been living a blissful life in the company of one another. The couple, however, do not share any children yet. Both of their busy schedules might be the main reason why they do not want to shoulder the responsibility just yet.</p><p>Considering Daamaris's age, the couple is exploring the possibility of adoption since having children of their own might not be feasible at this stage in life.</p><p>Unlike others who celebrate their wedding anniversary by cutting a cake or having a party, the pair commemorate it uniquely. Every year on their anniversary, Darrick and Damaris go to their wardrobe put on their wedding outfits, and recommit to one another by exchanging vows.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/18/darrick-wood--1581986381.jpg width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Darrick Wood and his wife Damaris Phillips at an event.&nbsp;</span><span class=imageSource> SOURCE: Damaris Phillips's Instagram (@chefdphillips)</span></strong><p>Darrick's wife Damaris revealed the reason for doing it is because they met at their friends Regan and Brad's wedding who also do the same and so they do the same as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Darrick is often active on social media and usually posts pictures and videos with his lovely spouse on them.
