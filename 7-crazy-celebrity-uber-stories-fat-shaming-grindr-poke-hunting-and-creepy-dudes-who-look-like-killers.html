The model announced Tuesday she plans to boycott the company after she shared a video of a driver commenting on her health in an Instagram post.</p><p>The driver in the video is heard questioning her cholesterol to which Holliday replied, "my cholesterol is fine, I'm perfect. I'm healthy."</p><p>She paired the video with an extensive caption saying she will no longer use the car service, and no one should have to tolerate such comments from an Uber driver.</p><p>"Hey @uber I don't pay more to use your "black car" service to be told that there's no way I could possibly be healthy because I'm fat & then questioning it. No one should have to tolerate this at any level of the services you offer. I'm fat. I also have a fat wallet & will no longer be using your services. Ever. Also after I told him I was healthy he turned the radio off & changed the subject. #putmymoneywheremymouthis #uberdriver #uber Edited to add: saying my driver is fat was obviously being used as a descriptor & not to insult him. Also I did not show his face or use his name when filming, it was to be able to show what I deal with daily & why this behavior is unacceptable from anyone."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><h2 class=h2>Busy Philipps</h2><p>Philipps filmed an <a href=#>eight-minute video</a> detailing a bizarre experience she and her husband had while Ubering their way home from Sunset Strip in 2017. Philipps revealed that she'd booked an UberBLACK, but when she and her husband got into the car they soon found out that they weren't alone.</p><p>"The craziest thing just happened to me and I feel like I need to share it with you," Philipps explained in the video. "I tried to call an Uber with my husband. We got into this Uber. The guy was really weird. I said to my husband 'That guy was weird, are you sure he's not going to kill us?' And from the back this voice is like 'I promise that won't happen.' And there was this scary dude in the way back of this Uber."</p><p>Philipps said that she and her husband ditched the Uber as quickly as possible and screamed "No!" repeatedly because she was convinced that the driver and the unknown passenger lurking in the third row were surely going to do her in.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7e85372f-b82a-5879-8c13-ec744384d8c7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8c158af3-7d9c-5135-a22d-247a5747db65 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7c/5by4/2017/04/09/7c4c0c67faf35723ac343d2e260e9963_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty Images</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Busy Philipps Says She Was 'Almost Murdered' During Uber Ride in Bizarre Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Kristen Bell</h2><p>Bell revealed on Twitter in 2015 that her Uber driver was playing his own version of "Carpool Karaoke."</p><p>"Didn't know @uber had a carpool option, but my driver just pulled over and said 'gotta pick someone else up.' this should be fun," she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Come to think of it, i did press 'pool' but i thought it was a fun summer reference. like how @google changes fonts to celebrate holidays."</p><p>After she revealed that the pickup resulted in a super awkward silence, she <a href=#>wrote</a>, "if I'm not home in 10 minutes pls call the police and tell them i was last seen in a honda accord with 2 males mutes. #ubercarpool."</p><p>Bell had a surprise in store, however, when one of the men in the car began belting out Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer."</p><p>"Breaking News," she <a href=#>tweeted</a>.
