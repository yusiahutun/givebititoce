<time>06 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It’s one of the most highly anticipated pop albums of 2023 and we’re getting a sneak peek already thanks to her newsletter. In a July 18, 2023, blast of <a href=# rel=nofollow>OnTheJLo</a>, we were given all the details of Jennifer Lopez’s “Midnight Trip to Vegas” lyrics and they’re almost certainly about eloping with her husband, Ben Affleck.</p><p>JLo and Ben tied the knot in Las Vegas three months after they announced their engagement in April 2022. TMZ first reported their wedding, by obtaining the couple’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">marriage license</a>&nbsp;in Clark County, Nevada on July 16, 2022. The marriage license includes both of their legal names: Benjamin Geza Affleck and Jennifer Lynn Lopez.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jennifer-lopez-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ben-affleck-britney-spears-kiss.png><p>Lopez and Affleck were previously engaged in 2003, after meeting on the set of the RomCom&nbsp;Gigli but they called it quits in 2004. “I am confirming the report that&nbsp;<a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>&nbsp;has ended her engagement to&nbsp;<a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>,” J-Lo’s rep said in a statement at the time. “At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.” In her 2014 memoir,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>True Love</a>, J-Lo referred to her and Ben’s breakup as the “first real heartbreak” she experienced. “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever,” she wrote.&nbsp;“It was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But they reconciled in 2021, having remained friends since their initial split. In July 2021, JLo posted a carousel of photos on Instagram in honor of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>her 52nd birthday</a>, confirming their rekindled romance was Instagram official.</p><p>Ben proposed to J-Lo in April 2022. In an installment of her OntheJLo fan newsletter, J-Lo revealed that she and Affleck were&nbsp;<a href=#>engaged</a>&nbsp;again. “Did you ever imagine your biggest dream could come true? Saturday night while at my favorite place on earth (in the bubble bath), my beautiful love got on one knee and proposed,” Lopez wrote in her newsletter. “I was taken totally off guard and just looked in his eyes smiling and crying at the same time trying to get my head around the fact that after 20 years this was happening all over again.” She continued, “I was quite literally speechless and he said, ‘Is that a yes?’ I said, ‘YES of course that’s a YES,’” she wrote. Lopez continued, “I was smiling so big and tears were coming down my face, feeling so incredibly happy and whole. It was nothing fancy at all, but it was the most romantic thing I could’ve ever imagined…just a quiet Saturday night at home, two people promising to always be there for each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1498067214.jpg><p>J-Lo described the details of her wedding with Ben in her newsletter&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>OntheJLo</a>&nbsp;on July 17, 2022. “Last night we flew to Vegas, and stood in line for a license with four other couples, all making the same journey to the wedding capital of the world.” She continued, “We are so grateful to have that in abundance, a new wonderful family of five amazing children and a life that we have never had more reason to look forward to. Stick around long enough and maybe you’ll find the best moment of your life in a drive-through in Las Vegas at twelve-thirty in the morning in the tunnel of love drive-through, with your kids and the one you’ll spend forever with. Love is a great thing, maybe the best of things-and worth waiting for.”</p><p>They celebrated their love again with a second wedding on August 19, 2022. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six,</a>&nbsp;the event was held for three days at Ben’s estate in Riceboro, Georgia—an hour outside of Savannah. The sprawling property sits on&nbsp;87 acres, and the main house has 3 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms and 6,000 sq ft of living space, according to TMZ. There was a rehearsal dinner on Friday, and the actual ceremony took place on Saturday. &nbsp;On Sunday, the wedding concluded with a barbecue and picnic on Sunday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=midnight-trip-to-vegas-lyrics>Midnight Trip to Vegas lyrics</h2><p>I always dreamed that I’d find somebody like you</p><p>We’re drowning<br>In orchid arrangements<br>Dresses and pastries<br>What if it’s raining, yeah?<br>Is this what we’ve been dreaming of?<br>It’s crowded with families and agents<br>Room reservations<br>Which destination<br>Paps helicopters<br>Event of the ages<br>Caught in the matrix<br>Then you whispered in my ear<br>Said let’s get out of here<br>We can disappear tonight</p><p>What about a<br>Midnight trip to Vegas<br>Just me and you baby<br>Throw the kids in the back<br>Of the pink Cadillac<br>And us in the bathroom changing<br>Midnight trip to Vegas<br>Both our hearts are racin’<br>I’ll pick you up late<br>We don’t have to wait<br>Yeah let’s do something crazy</p><p>Woohoo woohoo woohoo ooo<br>Woohoo woohoo woohoo ooo</p><p>We could be driving right now<br>20 miles into the desert by now<br>Your hand on my thigh<br>Laughin’ ‘til we cry<br>Didn’t tell a soul ‘bout how it’s goin’ down tonight<br>Top down singing Freddie Mercury<br>Waiting in the line at the DMV<br>“Just married” on the window<br>So glad that we could keep it simple<br>Then I whispered in your ear<br>I’m so glad we’re here<br>Dancing with our fears tonight</p><p>On a Midnight trip to Vegas<br>Just me and you baby<br>Throw the kids in the back<br>Of the pink Cadillac<br>And us in the bathroom changin’<br>Midnight trip to Vegas<br>Both our hearts are racin’<br>I’ll pick you up late<br>We don’t have to wait<br>Yeah let’s do something crazy</p><p>Woohoo woohoo woohoo ooo<br>Woohoo woohoo woohoo ooo</p><p>I always dreamed that I’d find somebody like you</p><p>What about a<br>Midnight trip to Vegas<br>Just me and you baby<br>Throw the kids in the back<br>Of the pink Cadillac<br>And us in the bathroom changing<br>Midnight trip to Vegas<br>Both our hearts are racin’<br>I’ll pick you up late<br>We don’t have to wait<br>Yeah let’s do something crazy</p><p>Woohoo woohoo woohoo ooo<br>Woohoo woohoo woohoo ooo</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/True-Love-Jennifer-Lopez.jpg><p>For more about J-Lo’s life, check out True Love by Jennifer Lopez.
