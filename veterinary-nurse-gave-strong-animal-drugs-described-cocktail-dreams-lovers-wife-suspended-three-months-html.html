prescription-only drugs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mrs LC replied: 'Tramadol not working anymore but diazepam will knock him out!!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later on, Ms Herdman messaged her friend saying: 'I left drugs for grumpy arse - forgot to say max dose are 10mg diazepam three times daily.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Herdman dropped a box of diazepam to Mrs LC's house which she had at home as a result of a prescription for her pet dog, Rigby.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She included additional information about the dosage, and insisted in the tribunal she did not provide tramadol and only supplied diazepam - which is a drug used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures or fits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Five months later, Mrs LC reported the woman for suppling the drugs and told the tribunal she had come to reflect on the damage that could be done to a veterinary practice when the dispensing of controlled drugs was not properly managed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said she was aware she was not without fault as she had asked for the drugs, and was also aware that reporting the incident might be regarded as 'sour grapes' as her husband was now in a relationship with Ms Herdman.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mrs LC told the disciplinary hearing she had become desperate about the extent pain was impacting her husband's well-being.</p><img id=i-d8b205faf93fa239 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/12/01/74234011-12399087-image-m-37_1691799750611.jpg height=523 width=634 alt="Ms Herdman was
