REM, individuals can still hear audio during hypnagogia while they dream, which can influence the content of dreams.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That's why the sound of music playing or people talking can often play a part in our dreams during the lightest sleep stages.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This state of mind is trippy, loose, flexible, and divergent,' said co-author Haar Horowitz at MIT Media Lab.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It’s like turning the notch up high on mind-wandering and making it immersive –being pushed and pulled with new sensations like your body floating and falling, with your thoughts quickly snapping in and out of control.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-bcfd757572c846e0

earliest stage of sleep, participants were asked to submit dream records" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The system in use.&nbsp;Upon awakening from hypnagogia, the earliest stage of sleep, participants were asked to submit dream records</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>MIT designed and developed their sleep-tracking device that can alter dreams by tracking hypnagogia.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The user decides what they want to dream about, from creative problems they are working on to an experience they want to reflect on or an emotional issue they want to address.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They then record themselves speaking an audio prompt using the app, which gets replayed during&nbsp;multiple stages of consciousness including wake, sleep onset and sleep.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These audio prompts can consist of anything the user decides they want to dream about, but in the case of MIT's experiments, they consisted of sentences including&nbsp;’remember to think of a tree’ and 'remember to observe your thoughts'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The hand-worn sleep tracker then monitors the wearer's heart rate and electrodermal activity&nbsp;– changes in the resistance of the skin to a small electrical current based on sweat gland activity.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These changes helped researchers detect when the wearer entered hypnagogia and was liable to incorporate 'information into dream content'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At this point, the audio prompts were delivered to the sleeper at precise times in the sleep cycle, ascertained by the incoming physiological data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Upon lying down, the web app instructed these participants to 'think of a tree'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Once entry into hypnagogia was determined by the app, a timer was triggered, which woke participants up at various times between one and five minutes, to allow participants 'to experience different depths of sleep'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the end of this time,&nbsp;participants were woken up with the words 'you're falling asleep' and were asked to report what was going through their mind, with verbal responses recorded.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The app then instructed them to 'remember to think of a tree' and that they could go back to sleep.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This loop of events was repeated for 45 min, enabling the collection of multiple hypnagogic reports', the experts say, at which point participants were fully awoken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Dream reports', which were then collected via audio and transcribed into typed text, revealed some far-fetched tree-related dream settings.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Overall, 67 per cent of dream reports from sleeping participants mentioned dreams involving a tree.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-2cfbc5863853c530

Waking up is still fairly easy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This stage is identified by short bursts of electrical activity in the brain known as spindles, and larger waves known as K-complexes, which indicate that the brain is still aware of what is going on around it before turning off to a sub-conscious level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Heartbeat and breathing is slow, and muscles relax even further.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Our body temperature drops and eye movements stop.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Stage 3</span>:&nbsp;Stage 3 non-REM sleep is the period of deep sleep that we need to feel refreshed in the morning.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Our heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep and brain waves become even slower.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Our muscles are relaxed and it people may find it difficult to awaken us.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The body repairs muscles and tissues, stimulates growth and development, boosts immune function, and builds up energy for the next day.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hypnagogia -
