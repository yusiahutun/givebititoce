He stated, “I’m her brother. She is not lost; she doesn’t want to return to foster care and is being a pain. I’ve contacted her, and she is in the Padstow region. But beyond that, she won’t tell me her location.”</p><p>He further expressed frustration, saying, “It is just in her nature. She has been with lovely carers who have tried to help her a lot, and she has been ungrateful.”</p><p>At present, there are no further details available regarding Jordan’s family or the circumstances surrounding her decision to go into hiding. Authorities have not released any recent updates on her situation.</p><p>Rest assured, we will continue to monitor the case closely and provide any developments as they arise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jordan-Webber-Case-Update.jpg><p>The safe recovery of the 13-year-old has brought relief to her family, friends, and the wider community.
