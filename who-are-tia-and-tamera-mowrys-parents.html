<time>28 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Although the twins rose to fame as young actors, there isn’t much information about Tia and Tamera Mowry’s Parents. Read on to find out who they are.</strong></p><p>Tia and Tamera Mowry are famous American twin actresses who rose to prominence in the 1900s. The pair announced their presence in Hollywood with their fantastic performance in the series “Sister, Sister.”</p><p>The pair starred in the series for six memorable seasons. Tia and Tamera played twins reunited as teenagers after childhood separation. The series helped launch their career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>In the series, Tia Mowry <a href=#>starred</a> as Tia Landry, the calm, intelligent twin, while Tamera, in contrast, played Tamera Campbell, an out-going boy-crazy twin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/c5/ea/03/c5ea037842bd5da423d923f93abf5eac.jpg><p>After the series ended, the twins took a break from television to study Psychology at Pepperdine University. But while they while in school, they also worked on some movie projects.</p><p>After “Sister, Sister,” the pair also starred together in the Tv film “Seventeen Again.” This time, however, they played relatives and not sisters. Their brother Tahj Mowry also appeared in the Showtime film.&nbsp;Transitioning into adulthood as famous child actors can sometimes be tricky, but Tia and Tamera successfully navigated this phase.&nbsp;</p><p>After working on multiple movies independently, the sisters reunited on-screen in 2005. They starred together in the Disney Original Movie “Twitches.” The twins also reprised their roles in the sequel “Twitches Too.”</p><p>In between “Twitches” and the sequel, Tia guest-starred on Tamera’s Lifetime show “Strong Medicine.” The sisters also co-authored a tween book series titled “Twintuition.” The four edition book narrates the story of two twin sisters, Cassie and Caitlyn, who discovered they have supernatural powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tia_and_Tameras_Reality_Series></span><strong>Tia and Tamera’s Reality Series</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2011 Tia and Tamera started a reality series titled “Tia and Tamera.” The series followed the sisters on their journeys. It detailed Tia’s journey through pregnancy and Tamera’s wedding plans.</p><p>During the episode titled “Failure to Communicate,” the sisters sought the help of a therapist to discuss their relationship with one another. While speaking in an interview with Ebony years later, Tamera explained showing their vulnerability was the episode’s purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Sadly, the twins disappointed fans when they separately announced on Twitter that the series would not continue after its third season. In her tweet, Tamera declared the series had served its purpose of showing their true selves.</p><p>However, in 2017, while hosting her talk show “The Real,” Tamera revealed another reason the series ended when it did. According to her, the producers wanted them to add artificial drama to their series.</p><p>At the time, the negative portrayals of African-American women dominated reality series. Tamer and her sister were not keen on incorporating that into their series. She <a href=#>disclosed</a>:</p><p><strong>“My sister and I are all about positivity and love, and especially for the African-American community.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tia_and_Tamera_Mowrys_Parents></span><strong>Tia and Tamera Mowry’s Parents</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tia and Tamera were born on July 6, 1978, to parents of mixed heritage. Their mother, Darlene Mowry, is of Afro-Bahamian origin, while their father, Timothy John Mowry, is an American.</p><p>Darlene and Timothy met while<a href=#> studying</a> at a high school in Miami, Florida. After graduation, the pair joined the U.S Army, and both reached the rank of Seargent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/77/5d/1e/775d1e9d74cc645840f62d8b617c4d90.jpg><p>In 1975, at the age of 18, the pair ran away to be married due to facing racism. Darlene and Timothy were both serving in the military in Germany when the couple welcomed Tia and Tamera.</p><p>In an interview with People, Tia declared she felt grateful to their parents for the sacrifices they made. Tia<a href=#> confessed</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“My parents, they were in the army. They ran away to be married at 18 years old. It was kind of like a little bit of a shotgun wedding, should I say. They had me and my sister at 21 years old.”</strong></p><p>Apart from Tia and Tamera, the pair are also parents to sons Tahj Mowry and Tavior Mowry.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tia_and_Tameras_Parents_Impact_On_Their_Career></span><strong>Tia and Tamera’s Parents’ Impact On Their Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tia and Tamera Mowry are now well-known and very successful celebrities. However, the twins would not be a success story without their parents. The twins were just two years old when their parents moved the family from Germany to Texas.</p><p>After a while, they moved to Hawaii before returning to Texas. It was during this time that Tia took an interest in acting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/57/27/45/57274513d377228323bf4e0407883085.jpg><p>Darlene subsequently got Tia engaged in print modeling and commercial work. Then, one summer, she took Tia to Los Angeles and promised that she would move the family to Los Angeles if the little girl got herself booked for a commercial or TV show.</p><p>Tia took on the challenge and got booked for a commercial. Afterward, Darlene had to present her case to the courts. Unfortunately, due to her work in the military, she could not just get up and leave. Tia <a href=#>revealed</a>:</p><p><strong>“If it weren’t for my mom, I wouldn’t be here. She worked so hard for us.”</strong></p><p>Thankfully the courts allowed the family to move to Los Angeles to get the kids fully immersed in Hollywood. However, their father had to stay behind in Texas, and only their mother was released.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Are_The_Parents_Now></span><strong>Where Are The Parents Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sadly, after four decades of marriage, Darlene and Timothy Mowry <a href=#>divorced</a>. The decision to get separated shocked their kids, who tried to discourage them. Finally, however, the kids had to accept their decision when they refused to budge.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>While speaking about her parent’s decision to get divorced, Tamera disclosed that she had gotten overly protective of her mother ever since it happened. She also explained that Darlene no treats her life like gold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jJqpnmWknq5urc2dZK2ZnZq%2FonnMqK6rsaNivaK%2BxKerrGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-tia-and-tamera-mowrys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-tia-and-tamera-mowrys-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-tia-and-tamera-mowrys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-tia-and-tamera-mowrys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-tia-and-tamera-mowrys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-tia-and-tamera-mowrys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stylish-older-women.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stylish-older-women.html>16 of the Most Stylish Ageless Women</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./parents-school-camera-toilet-london.html>Parents horror as cameras found hidden in primary school's toilets may have been there FIVE years</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./parents-school-camera-toilet-london.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
