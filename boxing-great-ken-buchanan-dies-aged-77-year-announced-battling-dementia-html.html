He was later told the incident inspired a similar scene in film Rocky.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buchanan returned to New York to fight the undefeated Duran. The Scot felt he was getting the better of his opponent when controversy struck, although reports from the time claimed the Panamanian was well ahead with the judges.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Duran's manager promised a rematch and Buchanan pressed his case by producing two more impressive wins at Madison Square Garden, beating Jim Watt in a classic British title fight, claiming the European belt and racking up wins around the world.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But calls to Duran's team were ignored and he waited until 1975 before getting another shot at the WBC title.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buchanan again felt he was the victim of skulduggery when a sparring partner poked him in the eye on the eve of his challenge against Guts Ishimatsu in Tokyo, and he lost on points after suffering triple vision.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He retired on medical advice because of vision problems later that year, after he and his father suffered cuts in a riot after he had knocked out his Italian opponent in Sardinia in a European title defence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buchanan concentrated on running his Edinburgh hotel but returned to the ring after a four-year absence - selling his business to fund a costly divorce settlement,</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He lost a European title fight against Irishman Charlie Nash in his third comeback bout and lost his last four professional fights before resorting to unlicensed fights in London nightclubs in a bid to clear debts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buchanan began working as a joiner but could not shake his anger with Duran and flew to New York on a whim in 1995, spending two weeks in Harlem in an unsuccessful attempt to confront his nemesis, who was still fighting at world-title level. But he buried the hatchet following a reunion in 2002 and the pair became friends.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alcohol problems intermittently dogged Buchanan and contributed to the breakdown of his second marriage but Buchanan remained a regular in Edinburgh's boxing gyms, passing on wisdom to young fighters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last year his son Mark revealed Buchanan had been diagnosed with dementia and said it was 'likely come as a result of his sport'. Because of the condition he was moved to a care home in Edinburgh.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As well as two children - Mark and Karen - from his first marriage, Buchanan had an older son, Raymond, who was born in 1966.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/sport/boxing/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span> <img id=i-2e8650bc8d63ee37 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/01/18/69370313-11928205-image-a-12_1680369049979.jpg height=788 width=634 alt="He was made an MBE in 1972 and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the Scottish Sport Hall of Fame.
