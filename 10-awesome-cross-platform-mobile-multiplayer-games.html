There's actually no need to choose between them, because cross-platform games can be played on both operating systems.</p><p>So, the next time you're looking for multiplayer games to play with friends, try the cross-platform mobile titles below.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=spaceteam>1. Spaceteam</h2><p>Spaceteam is the one game on this list that requires all your friends to be in the same physical space.</p><p>In Spaceteam, you and your friends are the crew of a spaceship and everything's going wrong. To stay on course, you'll need to work together by shouting different made-up space commands to each other. The speed and the chaos ramp up and up, until you all inevitably crash and die, only to be awarded medals posthumously. But it's fun while it lasts.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you have a smaller friend group, you can also try out the <a href=#>best two-player mobile games</a>.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Spaceteam for <a href=#>iOS</a> | <a href=#>Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=words-with-friends-2>2. Words With Friends 2</h2><p>The sequel to the acclaimed Words With Friends is more like an update.</p><p>Of course, there's the regular Words With Friends experience that you're used to, where you and a friend or online stranger take turns trying to rack up points on a board by spelling out words Scrabble-style.</p><p>However, while Words With Friends 2 keeps everything you loved about the first version, it adds a few new modes for a different sort of challenge.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Lightning Round pits two teams of five against each other to see who can come up with a certain score in the fastest amount of time. Solo Challenge lets you play against challenging bots to win a virtual prize. Finally, Words With Friends Live drops in with HQ Trivia-style questions during your game.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Words With Friends 2 for <a href=#>iOS</a> | <a href=#>Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=vainglory>3. Vainglory</h2><p>A MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) similar to League of Legends, Vainglory lets you team up in 5v5 or 3v3 modes against other players or bots.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Choose from one of over 40 heroes and go head to head against another team to destroy their Vain crystal before they destroy yours. Travel through the jungle destroying enemy turrets and minions, using your special powers, and working together as a team.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Vainglory for <a href=#>iOS</a> | <a href=#>Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=teamfight-tactics>4.

Minecraft</h2><p>Originally referred to as the Pocket Edition, the mobile version of Minecraft is almost identical to the PC version. The only major difference is that you can't connect third-party mods or use third-party servers. Also, typically, any update that comes out for Minecraft won't come out for the mobile versions until a later date.</p><p>That being said, the mobile version is a wonderful way to experience Minecraft on the go.</p><p>Playing Minecraft alone, however, is no fun. No matter the platform, Minecraft was made for socializing, and its cross-compatibility lets you play with your friends. If Minecraft doesn't sate your adventuring itch, you can try out these <a href=#>mobile games which let you explore the world</a>.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Minecraft for <a href=#>iOS</a> | <a href=#>Android</a> ($6.99 [iOS], $7.49 [Android], in-app purchases available)</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=hearthstone>6. Hearthstone</h2><p>Real-life trading card games are fun, but online trading card games let you do things like summon demons and blow up your booster packs.</p><p>Hearthstone, developed by Blizzard and set in the world of Warcraft, is a strategy game that lets you collect cards, build decks, and duel your friends.

You and your friends can take your phones, whether Android or iOS, and go out into the real world and explore.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Pokémon Go for <a href=#>iOS</a> | <a href=#>Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=pubg-mobile>8. PUBG Mobile</h2><p>The world's classic battle royale game is available on pretty much any platform you can think of, including iOS and Android.
