However, a decade ago, the singer was hardly sure of how her life would turn out in her 30s – but she did make some predictions.</strong></p><p>2023 was <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s year, according to Time Magazine. From making history with her Eras Tour to dominating both Spotify and Apple Music as the Artist of the Year, the <a href=#>music</a> star’s impact is practically worldwide. But a decade ago, when a young and promising country-turned-pop singer Taylor was on the rise, she could barely imagine what her life would be in her 30s. Although, looking at the throwback video, she did make some predictions that have come true.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-180223848-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-predicted-her-future-in-throwback-interview>Taylor Swift predicted her future in throwback interview</h2><p>The Grammy-winning star turned 34 today (December 13) and fans have unearthed an old video of her. The <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>, where a young Tay Tay is asked what her life will be like aged 34, she predicts her future somewhat.</p><p>When quizzed where she sees herself in ten years, Tay Tay is slightly surprised by the question. But she still tackles it head on. She replies: “In ten years I will be 34 and I don’t know if I’ll be on stage. I want to be creative in some way.”</p><p>Taylor expresses her love for songwriting in the video adding, “she would love to be writing songs for other people and be involved in the creative process even if it means, behind the scenes.”</p><p>The Cardigan crooner says, “there will be a void” if she is not creating songs anymore.</p><p>Considering Taylor directed her own music video All Too Well, which is literally behind the camera, was she predicting the future? Not only that, but she hasn’t given up writing songs at all. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> is still releasing new music, with two albums during the pandemic alone. This was before she announced her Midnights album last year. She still managed to squeeze in re-recording older tracks as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1851229371-807x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-shine-like-a-diamond-era>Taylor Swift’s ‘shine like a diamond’ era</h2><p>Taylor was awarded Billboard‘s Woman of the Decade Award in 2019. This was the beginning of when the world finally started to accept there is not that much that stops Taylor Alison Swift in terms of success. The award was even more significant for Swifties when the singer got candid on stage and shared one of her biggest life lessons.</p><p>Speaking of female artists in particular, Taylor said at the time: “In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their <a href=#>fashion</a>, or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist, I really like his songs but I don’t know what it is, there’s just something about him I don’t like? No! That criticism is reserved for us!”</p><p>But there’s a secret of why many may fade but Taylor didn’t: “But you know, I’ve learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art.”</p><p>The Folklore maker has kept her word and did not let anything break her apart. No matter a decade-long <a href=#>Kanye West feud</a> or the extreme criticism she gets for <a href=#>having a long list of ex-lovers</a>.</p><p>The singer is just entering a new phase of her career after becoming a <a href=#>billionaire,</a> and Taylor Swift fans all over the world can’t wait to see what’s next for the reigning pop queen.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aAcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02anq52UnrC1scNmn6ivXZ2ys3nCqKWtoZ6qsqV50q6anJ2jqHpyfIyynJqqo2KuqLuMoqVmrJinvLiuwJyiZq6ZmbKwew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-predicted-how-her-continued-success-10-years-ago-in-throwback-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-predicted-how-her-continued-success-10-years-ago-in-throwback-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-predicted-how-her-continued-success-10-years-ago-in-throwback-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-predicted-how-her-continued-success-10-years-ago-in-throwback-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-predicted-how-her-continued-success-10-years-ago-in-throwback-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-predicted-how-her-continued-success-10-years-ago-in-throwback-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-orange-is-the-new-blacks-flaca-is-important-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-orange-is-the-new-blacks-flaca-is-important-html.html>Why Orange Is the New Blacks Flaca Is So Important</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rock-island-county-property-owners-get-tax-bills-soon.html>Rock Island County property owners get tax bills soon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rock-island-county-property-owners-get-tax-bills-soon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
