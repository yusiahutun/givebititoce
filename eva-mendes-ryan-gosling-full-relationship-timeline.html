Review the full trajectory of their relationship ahead.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">May 3, 2024: Ryan reveals the sweet nickname their daughters use for him.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/film/ryan-gosling-fall-guy-barbie-fame-c7c8a5bf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Wall Street Journal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Gosling opens about how parenting has changed his life, and he reveals the nickname that his and Mendes’s daughters, Esmeralda and Amada, use for him: “Papi.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It kills me every time,” he says. “There’s just nothing, nothing better than that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The nickname, which translates from Spanish to “daddy,” makes sense, given that Mendes comes from a Cuban heritage. She’s previously said that she attempts to teach their daughters Spanish, but it’s difficult, because it often results in Spanglish. “[It’s] harder than I thought because I speak Spanglish and that’s what they’re picking up,” she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2019/05/21/eva-mendes-trying-teach-her-kids-spanish-but-spanglish-prevails/3751198002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said</a> on CBS’s The Talk. “It’s adorable, but it’s technically not a language.”</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">May 2, 2024: Eva gushes about Ryan in an interview.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mendes talks about her and Gosling’s family life in a rare interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/eva-mendes-praises-partner-ryan-gosling-for-supporting-her-exclusive-8642068 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> for the magazine’s “Beautiful” issue, explaining that leaving Hollywood to take care of their daughters was the “easiest” and best decision she ever made.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the chat, she also talks about why Gosling is the perfect partner, saying that they support one another unconditionally, and in every way. “I’m not going to tell you that, but in all the ways I need to be supported,” she says of how the Barbie star supports her. “He’s got me in all the ways.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mendes also notes that while she holds down the fort at home while Gosling is away at work, he usually takes care of the food. “I’m not a cook, so my man cooks and I clean—so it’s a nice even. I can’t cook. You don’t want me to cook,” she jokes. “My girls, they’re so cute, but they’re like, ‘Did you make these eggs, Mama?’ I’m like, ‘They’re eggs, yes. They’re just regular eggs.’ Who messes up eggs?”</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">January 24, 2024: Eva reacts to Ryan’s Oscar nomination.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the Academy announced Gosling’s Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as Ken in Barbie, Mendes takes to Instagram to congratulate her man—by sharing screenshots of a 2022 Rolling Stone article that blasted his casting as “cringe.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mendes explains in the caption, “So proud of my man. So much hate when he took on this role. So many people trying to shame him for doing it. Despite all the #Notmyken ridicule and articles written about him, he created this completely original, hilarious, heartbreaking, now iconic character and took it all the way to Oscars.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She concluded the sweet note, “So beyond proud to be this Ken’s Barbie.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">June 9, 2023: Ryan honors Eva at the Barbie premiere.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gosling brings the Kenergy to the world premiere of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, held July 9 at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall in Los Angeles.
