The next couple of episodes of Love Is Blind will show <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/jimmy-chelsea-still-together-love-is-blind/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy’s reaction when seeing Jessica</a> in real life for the first time. Keep reading for what’s happened to Love Is Blind‘s Jimmy, his partner Chelsea, and Jessica since leaving The Pods.</p><p>Jimmy Presnell and Chelsea Blackwell are one of five couples who got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind Season 6—sight unseen. Before their engagement, Jimmy and Chelsea were involved in a love square with Jess Vestal and Trevor Sova, other contestants on Love Is Blind Season 6. Jimmy broke up with Jess once he chose Chelsea. Chelsea, for her part, then broke up with Trevor once she learned that Jimmy had chosen her.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, which first premiered on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Netflix</a> in February 2020, follows around 30 men and women over the course of a couple weeks as they speed-date in “Pods,” where they can talk to each other but not see each other. During the 10 days, the couples can decide if they want to get engaged—still sight unseen. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on vacation at a resort in Mexico, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or break up as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Since the premiere of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>So how did Jimmy react when seeing Jessica for the first time?

However, the show hinted that the two might see each other in a later appearance.</p><p>Fans took to social media to talk about the way that Jimmy handled the situation. “Jimmy did not pick Chelsea over Jessica because she said she looked like Megan Fox, one<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix/comments/1aqv4wf/jimmy_isnt_a_bad_dude/> Redditor posted</a>. “He picked her because he did not want to be an instant stepfather and that is totally okay. Jimmy is not a bad person for not wanting to practically be a parent. He’s not what Jessica needed and that’s fine. Doesn’t make him evil.”</p><p>Another Redditor retorted, “That’s some BS he totally thought he was getting Megan fox at the reveal even though he was scared of being a step father, the attraction is what had him entirely focused or he wouldn’t mention it clearly on an episode stating “she lied to me about a few things” and also stating that she doesn’t look like Megan, his reaction said it all. Also his demeanour with the girls and clips from episodes that haven’t aired yet totally say he just wants someone else who is far more attractive than a stronger emotional bond. He literally told Jessica in a clip you’re still my number one. Hope both the women get as far away from him as possible because I smell a dumpster fire.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.4034280936455><h2>What happened to Jessica and Jimmy?</h2><p>What happened to Jessica and Jimmy? Jessica broke it off with Jimmy when she found out from Laura that he was going to propose to Chelsea. “You ruined this opportunity for me,” she told him in their last pod date. “I deserved so much more than what you’ve given me.” When he said he didn’t have his mind made up until that morning, she confronted him about how he told Chelsea he loved her the day before. She also told him that she’ll never be the woman who coddles him, if that’s what he’s looking for. And then she ended with: “When you see and realize what you missed out on, you are going to choke. You are going to need your EpiPen to open up your airways because you are going to be in disbelief of what you missed out on.”</p><p>She recounted to Entertainment Weekly that <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://ew.com/love-is-blind-season-6-jessica-vestal-talks-jimmy-presnell-breakup-8580312 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the speech was raised </a>from passion. “None of it was planned,” she says. “I went in there with just pure instinct and intuition, and I truly did not mean that he was going to choke because of seeing me physically. I meant in every sense of the word, because I know that I have so much to offer someone that he would definitely feel like he was missing out.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=19.363114231015><h2>How did Jessica react while leaving the show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/love-is-blind-jessica.jpg><p>How did Jessica react while leaving the show? Jessica felt confident that she had no regrets while leaving the show. “I have no regrets,” she told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/love-is-blind-season-6-jessica-interview-rcna138872 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Today</a>. “I really wanted to, like I said (on the show), give someone the opportunity to get to know me first and not lead with the fact that I’m a mother. Because although that is the most important part of who I am, it doesn’t define me.”</p><p>“Initially, when I found out he told Chelsea that he loved her and would likely be proposing to her, I did plan on leaving right then,” she says. “And then I went to sleep that night and I woke up the next morning and I was like, ‘No, I owe it to myself to have a last word with him and have some closure to it.'”</p><p>As for what her 10-year-old daughter thinks of her breakup, Jess told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/love-is-blind-jessica-vestal-daughter-had-hard-feelings-after-jimmy-presnell-pod-breakup-exclusive-8580321 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, “She’s very protective of me Her initial response was, ‘That’s his loss.'”</p><p>“She’s an extension of me, she’s a chip off the old block,” she continued. “So, she knows whatever is meant for me will be clear and evident and you shouldn’t have to wonder. If someone leaves you wondering where you stand with them, they’re not your person.”</p><p>&nbsp;Before the show, she said that she was “super nervous about how some of the guys are going to receive the fact that I have a child.”</p><p>She confessed, “I want to give people the chance to like, get to know me individually first because even though I’m a mother, and it’s the most important thing to me, it doesn’t define me,”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=13.154085872576><h2>Are Jimmy and Chelsea still together?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jimmy-Chelsea-Love-Is-Blind-Season-6.png><p>So are Jimmy and Chelsea still together from&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;Season 6? At the time of writing this, both Jimmy and Chelsea follow each other. Jimmy has also liked several of Chelsea’s posts from December 2023 to February 2024 when&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;Season 6 premiered. Chelsea, for her part, has only liked one of Jimmy’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;posts from him in New York City in January 2024.</p><p>Chelsea’s posts that Jimmy has liked includes a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Christmas selfie</a>&nbsp;in December 2023 and two&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;Season 6 promotional posts in January and February 2024, including Chelsea’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>announcement</a>&nbsp;that she was on&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;Season 6. “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me. Jk…tune in Feb 14th to find out! Only on Netflix! 💕 #loveisblind #netflix,” she captioned the post. What’s more interesting is that, at the time of writing this, Jimmy follows both Jess and Trevor. Chelsea, for her part, also follows both Jess and Trevor. Jess and Trevor also both follow Jimmy and Chelsea.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike past cities&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;has filmed in, such as Houston in Season 5 and Seattle in Season 4, marriage records for Charlotte, North Carolina—where Season 6 filmed—are not publicly available, so there isn’t a way to obtain Jimmy and Chelsea’s marriage records to confirm whether they’re still together.</p><p>Love Is Blind is now available to stream on Netflix.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7auudhmqp6dmaO0brbErKqim5Fk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-seeing-jessica.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjimmy-seeing-jessica.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-seeing-jessica.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjimmy-seeing-jessica.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-seeing-jessica.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-seeing-jessica.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./windows-remove-leftovers-uninstalled-software.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./windows-remove-leftovers-uninstalled-software.html>How to Eradicate Leftovers From Uninstalled Software in Windows 10 &amp;amp; 11</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ellen-pompeos-photos-of-her-3-kids-pics-of-stella-sienna-and-eli.html>Ellen Pompeo Photos of Her 3 Kids: Pics of Stella, Sienna and Eli</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ellen-pompeos-photos-of-her-3-kids-pics-of-stella-sienna-and-eli.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
