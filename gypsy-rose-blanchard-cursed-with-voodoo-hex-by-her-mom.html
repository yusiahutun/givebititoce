He was 36 and while she initially believed she was just 15, she discovered she was actually an adult and ran away to try and be with him. The only problem: She accidentally left her cell phone behind at home, which her mom found filled with messages about her plan. After contacting other convention-goers, one of whom knew Dan's address, Dee Dee tracked down her daughter.</p><p>"The first thing I say to her is, I know I'm 19 and I can stay here if I want to!" Gypsy recalled in the doc. "She's like, if you come back with me, I will let you see him. At that point, I believed her."</p><p>She said her mom also produced a doctored copy of her birth certificate, which said she was 15. As punishment for running away, Gypsy said her mother chained her to the bed for two weeks using handcuffs and a dog leash, which was connected to Dee Dee.</p><p>"She would not feed me every day and she would eat whatever she wanted," Gypsy continued, saying her mom also began beating her and slept with a knife by her bedside table, warning her against trying to run away again.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2a6fdc26-7a09-4ba6-8e63-4da86f747bd4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f1ec460c-7db7-4447-8093-53a2a9534b32 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/58/5by4/2024/01/03/580c05261e9b43bc9f3d4f1b1ba3d2f9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Courtesy of the Blanchard Family</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gypsy Rose Blanchard Reveals Prison Drug Use, Opioid Addiction Before Mom's Murder</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"After the two weeks I was chained, my mother put a voodoo hex on me. She printed out a picture of Dan and she printed out a picture of me and she went to the store and got a mason jar and a cow tongue," claimed Gypsy Rose. "She put the cow tongue in the mason jar with the two pictures and a little bit of my menstrual blood, put it in a mason jar, buried it in the backyard and said that you will never find love, you will never be happy."</p><p>Crying as she told the story, Blanchard then explained why she believed the hex was "true."</p><p>"I just think it's true because every time I get close to someone, they leave me. Many men write to me in prison, that's how I met Ken, we'd got engaged in 2019 but it didn't work out," she said. "I was still such a young girl, I had so much to learn about relationships. And he left me. And it broke my heart. And so it's like I always bring it back to that curse, where I believe that it's true. She never wanted me to find love or be happy and I feel like that stuck."</p><p>One of Gypsy Rose's cousins appeared on the series as well and said her claims were "not so far out of the bounds" of something Dee Dee would do. He pointed to her having a wizard tattoo on her leg and said she "would play with magic," Ouiji boards and practice spells when they were younger.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:050c38cd-585f-4d51-bae3-5640f8121a44 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f1ec460c-7db7-4447-8093-53a2a9534b32 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/28/5by4/2023/12/31/28a8a0b6b6b8408591bff5082076cf48_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gypsy Rose Blanchard Reveals Most Painful Unnecessary Surgery, Permanent Side Effects</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Curse or not, Blanchard is currently married to Ryan Anderson, fiercely defending him from trolls on social media this week.</p><p>"Ryan, donâ€™t listen to the haters.
