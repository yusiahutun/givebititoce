<time>01 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2>How did Matthew Perry Die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-matthew-perry-die.jpg><p>Initial reports into how Matthew Perry died claimed that there were no drugs found at the scene and no foul play was involved, however, an investigation into his cause of death is ongoing. After Perry’s death first made headlines, more information continued to emerge about his passing, with TMZ following up their story with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">details about the actor’s final hours</a>.</p><p>The outlet reported that Perry spent his morning playing pickleball and arrived home after a two-hour session on the court. When he got home, he reportedly sent his assistant out on an errand. When his assistant returned about two hours later, he found <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Perry unresponsive and called 911</a>. A rep for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed the call without identifying Perry, telling&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight, “West L.A. officers responded to [a residence] at 4:10 p.m. for a Death Investigation of a male in his 50s.”</p><p>While Perry’s cause of death remains unconfirmed, many fans of the Friends star can’t help but wonder if his sudden passing had anything to do with his past health struggles—including his battles with addiction to alcohol and Vicodin.</p><p>Perry’s battle with drug addiction started after he had a skiing accident on the set of the film&nbsp;When Fools Rush In&nbsp;in 1997. The doctor prescribed Vicodin for his pain, but as a highly addictive substance, Perry’s use escalated to taking up to 55 pills a day. Along with his opioid addiction, he suffered from alcoholism. In his 2022 memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, he explained how to tell which substance he was using based on his appearance on Friends: “When I’m carrying weight, it’s alcohol; when I’m skinny, it’s pills. When I have a goatee, it’s lots of pills.”</p><p>Five years before his passing, Perry was also open about the fact that he already had his fair share of brushes with death. He revealed in his memoir that he almost died after suffering a gastrointestinal perforation when his colon burst from&nbsp;opioid overuse. “The doctors told my family that I had a two percent chance to live,” he told&nbsp;People&nbsp;in 2022. “I was put on a thing called an ECMO machine, which does all the breathing for your heart and your lungs. And that’s called a Hail Mary. No one survives that.”</p><p>“There were five people put on an ECMO machine that night and the other four died and I survived,” he added. “So the big question is why? Why was I the one? There has to be some kind of reason.”</p><p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, Perry had another near-death experience while staying at a rehab center in Switzerland when he had to get surgery. During his procedure, he was given a shot of propofol. After 11 hours, he woke up in a different hospital and was told that the propofol had stopped his heart for five minutes. The long CPR process broke eight of his ribs.</p><p>While Perry often didn’t disclose how long he stayed sober, the actor was always open about his relapses. He had been to rehab 15 times, attended 6,000 AA meetings, been in detox 65 times, and spent between $7 to $9 million trying to get sober.</p><p>“It’s important, but if you lose your sobriety, it doesn’t mean you lose all that time and education,” he said. “Your sober date changes, but that’s all that changes. You know everything you knew before, as long as you were able to fight your way back without dying, you learn a lot.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/matthew-perry-book.jpeg><p>‘Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing’ by Matthew Perry</p><p>For more about Matthew Perry, read his memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=c44302c90f1fb94120d9107c47354ad1 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir","price":"17.09","id":"1250866456","category":"Performing Arts"},"id":1660168,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a> . The New York Times bestseller takes readers through Perry’s life and career, from his childhood dreams of becoming an actor to how he was cast in Friends to his struggle with addiction and his stints in rehab. “Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead,” Perry writes in the book. Told in his own words for the first time ever, the memoir is an “unflinchingly honest, moving, and uproariously funny” account of Perry’s trials and triumphs. Described as an “unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-opening,” Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing is a must-read for Friends fans.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, help is available.
