When talking about her career, Bell explained how precious her time on the show was over the years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kristen-Bell.jpg><h2 id=h-the-good-place-is-about-the-afterlife-and-morality>‘The Good Place’ is about the afterlife and morality</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_75>First premiering in 2016, The Good Place ran for four seasons on NBC. A couple of the cast members include Jameela Jamil and William Jackson Harper. The series reached critical acclaim and received a few awards.&nbsp;The story is about the afterlife, and humans get sent to either “the Good Place” or “the Bad Place.” To go to the Good Place, humans have to have a very high score based on their morality during life.</p><p id=par-3_54>In the beginning, Eleanor and Jason get sent to an experimental Bad Place, thinking they were in paradise.&nbsp;The characters have their assigned soulmates, with Eleanor meeting Chidi. Demons appear in the show, and they deal out torture in the Bad Place. Michael is one of the demons and has been erasing the humans’ memories.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_48>In 2020, The Good Place&nbsp;<a href=#>came to an end</a>, which many fans found emotional. Before becoming human, Michael designed a doorway for those in the Good Place to leave if they desire. The other characters decide to walk through the door when they feel it is time to go.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-kristen-bell-began-her-career-in-the-early-2000s>Kristen Bell began her career in the early-2000s</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_82>Bell was born in Michigan in a suburb of Detroit.
