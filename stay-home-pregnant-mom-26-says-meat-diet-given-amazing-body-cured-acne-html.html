Meat and specifically beef liver, is the most nutrient dense food that we have on the planet.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-9579c465bcfa8e53 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20131786-7609401-image-a-61_1571924300553.jpg height=476 width=634 alt="Surprised:&nbsp;Sara, with Gabe and son Zane after giving birth to her daughter Madisyn, said she never expected her diet would look as it does now" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Surprised:&nbsp;Sara, with Gabe and son Zane after giving birth to her daughter Madisyn, said she never expected her diet would look as it does now&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Our bodies are specifically designed to consume large amounts of this food group and many find that they feel the best doing so. The biggest misconception that I have seen about this way of eating is regarding saturated fats and cholesterol.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We are told that these are harmful to our health when in all reality that is so far from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Research it all for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I want others to see that this way of eating is not strange, unnatural, or crazy strict. It may seem that way to a lot of people who have never experience this way of eating but if you actually tried this diet for yourself you may just find it very liberating and freeing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My time is spent so much less in the kitchen yet my body feels better than ever. Traditional human diets, I believe, looked a lot like a carnivore's diet and so I truly think our bodies will thank us for eating in the end.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The best advice that I could give for someone wanting to eat this way would be to just eat meat, salt, and water for 30 days and see how you feel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Also, make sure that you are never leaving the table still feeling hungry; eat until satiated and that will really close the door on any temptations or cravings. Lastly, give yourself grace, because it's not always easy to give up things that we love in order to better our health but I promise that if you stick to it, it will be worth it in the end.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboOVaXBtaGFkoLWt2GafqKWVYr2zscanmKesXaK8rnmRb2Ssmamoeq6xwK1knaGVqXqotdWepWaZnZbHqrrGZpmonKlisLa%2BxJ1kmpuemnupwMyl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstay-home-pregnant-mom-26-says-meat-diet-given-amazing-body-cured-acne-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./apprentice-karren-bradys-daughter-wows-20759683.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./apprentice-karren-bradys-daughter-wows-20759683.html>The Apprentice Karren Brady's daughter wows in tiny crochet top on Dubai holiday</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html>Sarah Snook was 'dying inside' after being body-shamed on set</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sarah-snook-was-dying-inside-after-being-body-shamed-on-set.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
