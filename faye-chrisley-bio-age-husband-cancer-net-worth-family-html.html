In a string of allegations, all hotly contested by Chrisley, it is claimed that he wielded a knife and threatened to kill her and that, on one occasion, she witnessed him beating his own mother."</p><p>The relationship had a bitter end, but his first marriage experience didn't stop Todd from getting married again.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After the divorce from Teresa, Todd got involved&nbsp;in a marital relationship with <a href=# rel=follow>Julie Chrisley</a> in&nbsp;1996.</p><p></p><p><strong>The late 90's couple Todd and his second wife, Julie&nbsp;(</strong>Photo Credit: heavy.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Todd Chrisley has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">negative net worth</a> of around $5 million, which shows that the businessman is in debt. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking about the debts, back in April 2014, Todd, along with the business debt,&nbsp;had mortgages topping $12 million, owed the IRS more than $500,000, and even had a loan worth $4.4million from his former beauty queen wife, Julie.</p><p>His money troubles brought him to be such low that he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">forced</a> his mother out of her home.&nbsp;Although Todd&nbsp;claimed to be a&nbsp;millionaire&nbsp;on the show, he&nbsp;got disabled in debt and could no longer afford&nbsp;the upkeep of his mother's home.</p><p>Randy Chrisley is the younger son of Faye Chrisley, who is indeed a low-profile personality.

Recently her grandchild Chase Chrisley shared a picture of his grandmom&nbsp;holding a cigar in her hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Though she looks adorable with her pink hat and pearl earrings, we don’t usually see a 77 year old enjoying her time like this.&nbsp;As much lovely as her aura is, she seems to be equally witty and wild.
