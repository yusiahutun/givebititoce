<time>06 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For bike-share companies built on concepts first seen elsewhere, for instance, the real innovation was&nbsp;app-driven “dockless” bicycles than could&nbsp;be unlocked and peddled almost anywhere, as long as you had&nbsp;your smartphone handy. &nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was an early adopter, having long been dismayed that the Bicycle Kingdom had become an Automobile Republic. In the years before Ofo or Mobike, theft was a real concern, seriously limiting where you could take a bike. It was liberating to cycle to a subway station, park the thing and forget about it. &nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One day, however, while peddling a Mobike home, I noticed two more in a canal. With President Xi Jinping calling the shared-economy “China’s gift to the world”, and the government dishing out generous tax breaks to the industry, saturation point had already been reached in the capital; there were too many bikes vying for too few commuters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As I Ofoed my way through 2017, I found discarded bicycles everywhere: abandoned in parks or blocking alleyways. Despite their obvious benefits, the two-wheeled debris piled-up, exposing both public and corporate negligence. An environmental solution was becoming an environmental problem. The bikes were left broken or damaged, prompting local authorities to dump the excess machines en masse in makeshift compounds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I first saw the bicycle graveyards on TV,” says Shenzhen-based photographer Wu Guoyong of his decision to photo­graph the man-made aluminium mountains. “I didn’t catch the location, so I asked my friends on WeChat if they knew where the bicycles had been left. I eventually found out and took my drone to take some pictures.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wu is a relative newcomer to China’s contem­porary photo­graphy scene, though his interest was sparked in the early years of reform, when a cameraman came to shoot a hydroelectric facility he was working at in Tianjin, in China’s northeast. “I just saw him take pictures and thought that looked interesting, so I bought a Fenghuang camera. It was 1984 and cost me 180 yuan when my salary was just 40 yuan a month.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born in what Wu calls “the ancient heart of China” – near the prefecture-level city of Xiangyang, in Hubei province – in 1963, he studied hydraulic engineering in the provincial capital of Wuhan before joining the ranks of state employees tasked with managing China’s waterways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/01/b2586cea-8be1-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_1320x770_160322.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In those days, you didn’t choose where you wanted to work, your work unit sent you. I spent five or six years in Tianjin, then came back to Hubei. I found my way to Shenzhen in 1992, working on bridges and pipes, that kind of thing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Contributing his expertise to the con­struction of a new city would prove taxing yet lucrative. The 1990s saw Wu focused on raising a family and making money. But, in 2008, with his children grown, he returned to his passion for photography. “I bought a digital camera in 2008 because I began travelling,” he says. “I just took pictures of pretty things, as I had no real conception of art photo­graphy. In 2011, I was able to retire early and focus on photography.”</p>A few years later, a mutual friend intro­­duced Wu to Shenzhen-based photo­grapher <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Li Zhengde</span></a>. “Zhengde made a huge impression on me,” Wu says. “He taught me that a photographer could be an artist, that we could ask social questions with a camera. Every time I left his house, I borrowed at least two books.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seeking to emulate Li’s view that a photographer’s voice can be as powerful as that of a writer, Wu invested in a Shenzhen-designed-and-built DJI drone and set about photographing the city. His signature style, and commitment to wait for the correct light and conditions – sometimes checking into remote hotels or staying up all night – has won Wu praise from his peers and a commission from the Nanshan government to contribute to two photo albums promoting the district.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet Wu was still looking for that all-important “social question” to ask and, when the bikes began to pile-up, he saw the drone would enable him to illustrate the phenomenon from a different perspective.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, you name it,” says Wu, who visited 15 major cities for the project.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese bike-sharing firms pull 3,000 dumped bikes out of rivers</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The result is an award-winning series called “No Place to Place” that – while captivatingly beautiful – questions the brutal efficiency of China’s industrial machine, as well as the human capacity to neglect commodities on a scale unseen in history. Wu is of a generation, after all, that once deemed a bicycle to be one of “the four big things” that everyone in China aspired to own, along with a sewing machine, a wrist-watch and a radio.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I see shared bikes as useful, but the cemeteries expose a moral problem in the landscape of China,” says the photo­grapher. “We’re throwing away bikes! That just doesn’t seem right.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Listen to a selection of Post Magazine stories, read by us:</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5FqbG9xZ2p8pLTIp5isZZKeuKZ50qGYq6GenHqjwcGbo55lmJbAbq7Uq6qtZZSnvK%2Bx</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mirtha-legrand.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mirtha-legrand.html>Mirtha Legrand</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./big-brothers-jared-fields-was-single-before-blue-kim-showmance.html>Big Brother's Jared Fields Was Single Before Blue Kim Showmance</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./big-brothers-jared-fields-was-single-before-blue-kim-showmance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
