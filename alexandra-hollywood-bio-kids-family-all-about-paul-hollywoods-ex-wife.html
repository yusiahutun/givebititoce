Want to know more about Hollywood as well as details about her divorce? Keep reading below for more information.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexandra-hollywoods-bio-age></span><strong>Alexandra Hollywood’s Bio (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alexandra Hollywood (<span data-dobid=hdw>née </span>Moores) was born on the 11th of May 1964 in Kent, England. Her late father, Michael Moores, was a construction industry executive while her mom, Gloria, is a journalist who worked at the international news desk of the BBC. Additionally, the media personality has two siblings including an elder brother named Simon.</p><p>Alexandra Hollywood grew up in Kent and attended a private Ursuline Convent. While growing up, her mom, who is half-French and half-Norwegian, tutored her in Scandinavian and French cooking styles. She, therefore, became passionate about food and cooking in general.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Upon finishing school, Hollywood completed a secretarial course and thereafter proceeded to work in PR for various organizations, which include London-based luxury goods firms such as Loewe and Nicole Farhi. She also worked as a chalet girl in France and as a diving instructor in Cyprus before returning to her true passion for cooking.</p><p>Nowadays, Alexandra Hollywood is a career foodie and an avid chef. She not only applies her talents for family and friends but has worked with other chefs to develop and improve on recipes. She is also a family food writer and her recipes have been published in various publications. Additionally, the Kent native has authored at least two cookbooks ‘My Busy Kitchen’ and ‘Cooking Tonight’. She has also made multiple TV appearances.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-husband-and-kids></span><strong>Family: Husband And Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alexandra Holiday was previously married to Paul Hollywood, a celebrity chef/master baker who was born on the 1st of March 1966 in Liverpool, England. He completed his secondary education at the Mosslands School before studying sculpture at the Wallasey School of Art. Paul later dropped out of school in order to work in his father’s bakery. He eventually went on to become a head baker at several restaurants, both at home and abroad. Paul Holiday is now a popular TV personality; he is a long-time judge on the hit British show, The Great British Bake Off. The show features a group of amateur bakers competing for a star prize.</p><p>Alexandra Hollywood first met her future husband in 1996 whilst working as a scuba diving instructor at a five-star hotel in Cyprus. Paul was the head baker at the restaurant and brought assorted baked goods for the staff at the diving school. The two were immediately attracted to each other and thereafter commenced a relationship. They dated for two years and tied the knot in Cyprus in 1998. The couple eventually returned to Britain in 1999. Holiday and her husband enjoyed a strong and happy marriage for several years and she helped to build his career. She set him up for his very first TV appearance, back in Cyprus. From there, he was able to land lucrative gigs on The Great British Bake Off as well as its American counterpart, The American Baking Competition. On the personal side, Holiday and her husband have a son named Joshua. He was born in October 2001 and is the couple’s only child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexandra-hollywoods-divorce></span> <strong>Alexandra Hollywood’s </strong><strong>Divorce</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alexandra Hollywood’s marriage first ran into trouble in 2013 when her husband had an affair with his American Baking Competition co-judge, Marcela Valladolid. The whole thing predictably devastated her and she filed for divorce. She, however, had a change of heart after her husband publicly admitted the affair and apologized. She, therefore, decided to give her husband a second chance, for the sake of their love as well as their son. The couple subsequently reconciled and resumed marital life.</p><p>This second phase of their union lasted for four years before the chef resumed his wandering ways. The exasperated Alexandra Hollywood once again filed for divorce in August 2017, citing adultery as the reason for the divorce. It is expected that Alexandra Hollywood will get half of her husband’s fortune, which is estimated at £10 million. She is also set to get the couple’s marital home which is valued at £2.4 million. Paul, on the other hand, has resumed his love life with a barmaid named Summer Monteys-Fullam.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmcmsWiusOrmGagn6G5usPOqJtmmpmkeqy1w6xkn5mdnrm6ecClo2aZkqTCtXnPmqylZZikua3F1qimnatdmsVuw8ifnGhkXGF5bXiL</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falexandra-hollywood-bio-kids-family-all-about-paul-hollywoods-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falexandra-hollywood-bio-kids-family-all-about-paul-hollywoods-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falexandra-hollywood-bio-kids-family-all-about-paul-hollywoods-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falexandra-hollywood-bio-kids-family-all-about-paul-hollywoods-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falexandra-hollywood-bio-kids-family-all-about-paul-hollywoods-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falexandra-hollywood-bio-kids-family-all-about-paul-hollywoods-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./capucine-and-dirk-bogarde.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./capucine-and-dirk-bogarde.html>Capucine and Dirk Bogarde - Dating, Gossip, News, Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./49-facts-about-india-love.html>49 Facts About India Love</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./49-facts-about-india-love.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
